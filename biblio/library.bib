abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) continue to show strong promise as the channel material for an aggressively scaled, high-performance transistor technology. However, there has been concern regarding the contact resistance (Rc) in CNT field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) limiting the ultimate performance, especially at scaled contact lengths. In this work, the contact resistance in CNTFETs is defined in the context of a high-performance scaled transistor, including how the demonstrated Rc relates to technology targets. The impact of different source/drain contact metals (Pd, Pt, Au, Rh, Ni, and Ti) on the scaling of Rc versus contact length is presented. It is discovered that the most optimal contact metal at long contact lengths (Pd) is not necessarily the best for scaled devices, where a newly explored scaled metal contact, Rh, yields the best scaling trend. When extrapolated for a sub-10 nm transistor technology, these results show that the Rc in scaled CNTFETs is within a factor of 2 of the technology target with much potential for improvement through enhanced understanding and engineering of transport at the metal-CNT interface.},

abstract = {Properties of natural rubber (NR) filled with various fillers, i.e., furnace black (N330), conductive carbon black (XE2-B), and carbon nanotube (CNT) were investigated. Both untreated and sonicated carbon nanotubes were used and designated as U-CNT and S-CNT, respectively. The filler content was varied from 0 to 8 phr. Regardless of the filler type, the increase in the filler content not only results in increased compound viscosity, reduced cure time, and enhanced cross-link density but also leads to the increase in the modulus and hardness of the vulcanizates. For N330 and XE2-B, the tensile strength increases continuously with increasing filler content. However, for both U-CNT and S-CNT, the tensile strength tends to increase with increasing filler content up to 2 phr and decreases noticeably afterward. At any given filler content, the CNTs give the vulcanizates with the highest values of electrical and thermal conductivities, storage modulus, and tan $\delta$, followed by XE2-B and N330, respectively. Results also elucidate that the sonication of CNT without the presence of surfactant prior to mixing could not improve the degree of CNT dispersion, leading to insignificant difference in properties of the U-CNT-filled and S-CNT-filled vulcanizates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Exact calculations are made for the energy and momentum of excitations having single-particle character. Unlike the situation for the half-filled band, we find no gap in the excitation spectrum. We have also considered excitations of the spin-wave type. These are shown to vary linearly with momentum for small momentum.

abstract = {Catalyst annealing time and growth pressure play a crucial role in the chiral selective and high-efficiency growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) during low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). We achieved a high growth rates for SWCNTs and a change the chiral distribution towards metallic (n, m) increasing the catalyst annealing time in hydrogen. A strong correlation is revealed between the catalyst annealing time at lower growth pressures and the shape of the G band, which indicates the metallic or semiconducting nature of the SWCNT and predict the chirality distribution. Under a 15 min annealing time and 10 mbar of growth pressure, the bottom of the G band is broadened with a sharp G- peak, and the G-band exhibited asymmetrical Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF) shape. In addition, the growth of SWCNTs with smaller diameters and rich in metallic character is confirmed by the shift of the G-band to a smaller Raman frequency. Homogeneity and vertical alignment of as-grown SWCNT arrays are optically studied using UV/vis/NIR Spectrophotometer. Wavelength-independent and low reflectance resulted from the growth of uniform arrays of SWCNTs. Because of their tunable electronic and optical properties, selective growth of SWCNTs promises great application potential, particularly in electronics and solar industries.},

abstract = {We present an implementation of the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method for carrying out ab initio calculations of the ground state electronic properties of (magnetic) metallic nanowires and nanotubes based on the density-functional theory (DFT). The method is truly one-dimensional, uses explicitly a wire geometry and is realized as an extension of the FLEUR code. It includes a wide variety of chiral symmetries known for tubular and other one-dimensional systems. A comparative study shows that in this geometry computations are considerably faster than the widely used supercell approach. The method was applied to some typical model structures explored in the field of nanospintronics: the gold nanowire Au(6,0), the free-standing Fe monowire, and the hybrid structure Fe@Au(6,0). Their atomic structures are determined by total energy minimization and force calculations. We calculated the magnetic properties including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies, the band structures, and densities of states in these systems using the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the DFT. The results agree nicely with the data available in the literature. We found that Fe wires are ferromagnetic and are prone to a Peierls dimerization. The Fe filled gold nanotube shows a large negative spin polarization at the Fermi level, which makes this structure a possible candidate for spin-dependent transport applications in the field of spintronics. The Au tube encasing the Fe wire changes the magnetization direction of the Fe wire and increases the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy by an order of magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are a versatile material in which many aspects of condensed matter physics come together. Recent discoveries have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our understanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin and valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding of transport through nanotube devices. Unlike in conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular momentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and valley freedom. The interplay between the two is the focus of this review. The energy levels associated with each degree of freedom, and the spin-orbit coupling between them, are explained, together with their consequences for transport measurements through nanotube quantum dots. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers modifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade. This can be exploited to read out spin and valley qubits and to measure the decay of these states through coupling to nuclear spins and phonons. A second unique property of carbon nanotubes is that the combination of valley freedom and electron-electron interactions in one dimension strongly modifies their transport behavior. Interaction between electrons inside and outside a quantum dot is manifested in SU(4) Kondo behavior and level renormalization. Interaction within a dot leads to Wigner molecules and more complex correlated states. This review takes an experimental perspective informed by recent advances in theory. As well as the well-understood overall picture, open questions for the field are also clearly stated. These advances position nanotubes as a leading system for the study of spin and valley physics in one dimension where electronic disorder and hyperfine interaction can both be reduced to a low level.},

abstract = {Downscaling of the contact length Lc of a side-contacted carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET) is challenging because of the rapidly increasing contact resistance as Lc falls below 20-50 nm. If in agreement with existing experimental results, theoretical work might answer the question, which metals yield the lowest CNT-metal contact resistance and what physical mechanisms govern the geometry dependence of the contact resistance. However, at the scale of 10 nm, parameter-free models of electron transport become computationally prohibitively expensive. In our work we used a dedicated combination of the Green function formalism and density functional theory to perform an overall ab initio simulation of extended CNT-metal contacts of an arbitrary length (including infinite), a previously not achievable level of simulations. We provide a systematic and comprehensive discussion of metal-CNT contact properties as a function of the metal type and the contact length. We have found and been able to explain very uncommon relations between chemical, physical and electrical properties observed in CNT-metal contacts. The calculated electrical characteristics are in reasonable quantitative agreement and exhibit similar trends as the latest experimental data in terms of: (i) contact resistance for Lc = [infinity], (ii) scaling of contact resistance Rc(Lc); (iii) metal-defined polarity of a CNTFET. Our results can guide technology development and contact material selection for downscaling the length of side-contacts below 10 nm.},

abstract = {Noble metal nanoparticles are capable of confining resonant photons in such a manner as to induce coherent surface plasmon oscillation of their conduction band electrons, a phenomenon leading to two important properties. Firstly, the confinement of the photon to the nanoparticle's dimensions leads to a large increase in its electromagnetic field and consequently great enhancement of all the nanoparticle's radiative properties, such as absorption and scattering. Moreover, by confining the photon's wavelength to the nanoparticle's small dimensions, there exists enhanced imaging resolving powers, which extend well below the diffraction limit, a property of considerable importance in potential device applications. Secondly, the strongly absorbed light by the nanoparticles is followed by a rapid dephasing of the coherent electron motion in tandem with an equally rapid energy transfer to the lattice, a process integral to the technologically relevant photothermal properties of plasmonic nanoparticles. Of all the possible nanoparticle shapes, gold nanorods are especially intriguing as they offer strong plasmonic fields while exhibiting excellent tunability and biocompatibility. We begin this review of gold nanorods by summarizing their radiative and nonradiative properties. Their various synthetic methods are then outlined with an emphasis on the seed-mediated chemical growth. In particular, we describe nanorod spontaneous self-assembly, chemically driven assembly, and polymer-based alignment The final section details current studies aimed at applications in the biological and biomedical fields. {\textcopyright} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract = {Pristine, oxidized and defunctionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were studied by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and low temperature nitrogen adsorption. The Raman spectra of the studied samples in the range of 900-1800 cm-1 were deconvoluted into five components to reveal the CNT oxidation mechanism. It was found that the oxidation resulted in the reduction of graphite components and ordering of both the structured and defect part of CNTs. Acid treatment also led to different types of disorders in the surface layers of CNTs. Polyene-type, polyphenylene-type and turbostratic fragments were detected as a result of partial exfoliation. Investigation of defunctionalized CNTs showed the ordering of edge carbon atoms as well as the invariability of the total amount of defects. The study of CNTs as supports for Co-based catalysts revealed a simultaneous decrease in the number of defect fragments and increase in the number of edge carbon atoms during catalyst preparation and reduction.},

We found the lithiophobic graphitic surfaces hindered lithium insertion into the scaffold despite the high conductivity of CNT. The lithiophilic surface caused another problem of lithium deposition on the outer surface of the electrode, clogging pores and engendering dendrites. Conversely, in the hybridized CNT, lithiophilic trenches partially created on the pristine CNT allowed for uniform lithium deposition into the pores by simultaneously improved lithium attraction and charge transfer, reaching a high areal capacity of 16 mAh cm-2 even with a current density of 8 mA cm-2 without noticeable dendrite formation and volume expansion. Our hybridization approach provides valuable insight to realize a high-energy-density anode by uniformly impregnating lithium into porous media.},

A general and natural choice is to share the charge density at each point among the several atoms in proportion to their free-atom densities at the corresponding distances from the nuclei. This prescription yields well-localized bonded-atom distributions each of which closely resembles the molecular density in its vicinity. Integration of the atomic deformation densities — bonded minus free atoms — defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule. Sample results for several molecules indicate a high transferability of net atomic charges and moments.},

@article{Yang2011,
abstract = {Background: Morphine (MP), a group of narcotic pain relieve drugs, is frequently used to relieve severe pain for patients, especially for those who undergo a surgical procedure. However, when overdosed or abused, MP is toxic and can cause disruption in the central nervous system. Therefore, to prevent overdose-induced toxication, it is necessary to sensitively determine the concentrations of MP in patient's blood or urine. Methods: We report an easy-to-use approach for directly electrodepositing gold nanotube arrays onto an anodic aluminum oxide template (AAO) by performing cyclic voltammetry for a short period of time. Morphological characterization of gold nanotubes demonstrates that the inner diameter of gold nanotubes becomes smaller upon the increase of deposition time. An electrochemical sensor for direct determination of morphine was constructed by attaching gold nanotube arrays onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Results: The resulting electrochemical sensor offers an excellent response for morphine in the concentration range of 1.22×10×7-7.44×10×4mol/l with a detection limit of 4.06×10×8mol/l and a correlation coefficient of 0.995. Conclusion: The electrochemical sensor shows good regeneration, stability and selectivity and has been used for the determination of morphine in serum samples with satisfied results. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Contacting metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes by palladium (Pd) affords highly reproducible ohmic contacts and allows for detailed elucidation of ballistic transport in metallic nanotubes. The Pd ohmic contacts are more reliable than titanium (Ti) previously used for ballistic nanotube devices. In contrast, Pt contacts appear to give non-ohmic contacts to metallic nanotubes. For both ohmic and non-ohmic contacts, the length of the nanotube under the metal contact area is electrically turned off. Transport occurs from metal to nanotube at the edges of the contacts. Measurements with large numbers of Pd contacted nanotube samples reveal that the mean free path for defect scattering in SWNTs grown by chemical vapor deposition can be up to 4 microns. The mean free paths for acoustic phonon scattering are on the order of 500 nm at room temperature and >> 4 microns at low temperatures.},

abstract = {Maghemite (c-Fe2O3)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) hybrid-materials were synthesized and their anisotropic electrical conductivities as a result of their alignment in a polymer matrix under an external magnetic field were investigated. The tethering of c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of MWCNTwas achieved by a modified sol–gel reaction, where sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (NaDDBS) was used in order to inhibit the formation of a 3D iron oxide gel. These hybrid-materials, specifically, magnetized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (m-MWCNTs) were readily aligned parallel to the direction of a magnetic field even when using a relatively weak magnetic field. The conductivity of the epoxy composites formed in this manner increased with increasing m-MWCNT mass fraction in the polymer matrix. Furthermore, the conductivities parallel to the direction of magnetic field were higher than those in the perpendicular direction, indicating that the alignment of the m-MWCNT contributed to the enhancement of the anisotropic electrical properties of the composites in the direction of alignment.},

abstract = {AIM dual parameter analysis is proposed for the better understanding of weak to strong interactions: Total electron energy densities (H b(rc) are plotted versus Laplacian of electron densities ($\Delta$$\rho$b(rc)) at bond critical points (BCPs). Interactions examined in this work are those in van der Waals adducts, hydrogen bonded complexes, molecular complexes and hypervalent adducts through charge transfer (CT) interactions, and some classical covalent bonds. Data calculated at BCPs for the optimized distances (ro), together with ro - 0.1 {\AA}, ro + 0.1 {\AA}, and ro + 0,2 {\AA}, are employed for the plots. The plots of Hb(rc) versus $\Delta$$\rho$b(rc) start from near origin (H b(rc) = $\Delta$$\rho$b(rc) = 0) and turn to the right drawing a helical stream as a whole. The helical nature is demonstrated to be controlled by the relative magnitudes of kinetic energy densities (Gb(rc)) and potential energy densities (V b(rc)), where Gb(rc) + V b(rc) = Hb(rc). Requirements for the data to appear in the specified quadrant are clarified. Points corresponding to the data will appear in the first quadrant ($\Delta$$\rho$b(r c) > 0 and Hb(rc) > 0) when -V b(rc) < Gb(rc), they drop in the forth one ($\Delta$$\rho$b(rc) > 0 and H b(rc) < 0) if -(1/2)Vb(rc) < Gb(rc) < - Vb(rc), and they appear in the third quadrant ($\Delta$$\rho$b(rc) < 0 and Hb(rc) < 0) when Gb(rc) < -(1/2)Vb(rc). No points will appear in the second quadrant ($\Delta$$\rho$b(rc) < 0 and Hb(r c) > 0). The physical meanings of the plots proposed in this work are also considered. The helical nature of the interactions in the plots helps us to understand the interactions in a unified way. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Finally, we review exciton-specific phenomena in the resonance Raman spectra of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Raman spectroscopy of SWNTs has been especially useful for understanding many fundamental properties of all sp2 carbons, given SWNTs can be either semiconducting or metallic depending on their geometric structure, which is denoted by two integers (n,m).},

abstract = {Nanocomposites, multiphase solid materials with at least one nanoscaled component, have been attracting ever-increasing attention because of their unique properties. Graphene is an ideal filler for high-performance multifunctional nanocomposites in light of its superior mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties. However, the 2D nature of graphene usually gives rise to highly anisotropic features, which brings new opportunities to tailor nanocomposites by making full use of its excellent in-plane properties. Here, recent progress on graphene/polymer nanocomposites is summarized with emphasis on strengthening/toughening, electrical conduction, thermal transportation, and photothermal energy conversion. The influence of the graphene configuration, including layer number, defects, and lateral size, on its intrinsic properties and the properties of graphene/polymer nanocomposites is systematically analyzed. Meanwhile, the role of the interfacial interaction between graphene and polymer in affecting the properties of nanocomposites is also explored. The correlation between the graphene distribution in the matrix and the properties of the nanocomposite is discussed in detail. The key challenges and possible solutions are also addressed. This review may provide a constructive guidance for preparing high-performance graphene/polymer nanocomposite in the future.},

Both adsorption and migration of Li and K are studied for a range of pristine and nitrogen-doped CNTs, which are further compared with 2D graphene-based counterparts. We use detailed electronic structure analyses to reveal that different doping defects are advantageous for carbon nanotube-based and graphene-based models, as well as that curved CNT walls help facilitate the penetration of potassium through the doping defect while showing a negative effect on that of lithium.},

abstract = {The main drawback of current piezoresistive pressure sensors is the drop of output voltage with increase in the operating temperature which severely reduces the measurement accuracy. This paper presents a novel passive technique for temperature compensation of silicon piezoresistive pressure sensors. The built-in compensation technique eliminates the need for expensive and time consuming calibration process required for each sensor inside a fabricated batch. In this technique, extra polysilicon resistors with negative Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity (TCR) are employed for compensation purpose. Through applying this technique, Temperature Coefficient of Sensitivity (TCS) of the conventional non-compensated sensor was reduced to zero. Analytically derived equations and verified Finite Element Model considering mechanical, piezoresistive and electrical characteristics of the sensor are adapted to analyze the behavior of the sensor. The implementation of the introduced technique is compatible with conventional MEMS devices fabrication process. The compensated sensor is advantageous for pressure measurement in harsh environments with temperature variations.},

abstract = {The effect of chemical etching on the electrochemical intercalation of lithium into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was investigated. The results showed that the charge capacity of etched MWNTs is greater than the theoretical capacity of graphite. Moreover, the charge curve does not show a well-defined voltage plateau. To explain this phenomenon, we proposed a non-GIC (graphite intercalation compound) mechanism that, except for the lithium intercalated between graphene layers to form graphite intercalation compounds, the higher charge capacity should be related to lithium doped into such regions as disordered graphitic structures, defects, microcavities, and edges of graphitic layers, which is generally called a non-GIC mechanism in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The potential applications of carbon nanotubes grown for semiconductor and sensor devices are immense. But, this growth must be CMOS compatible and over large-areas, in excess of 4 inches in diameter, for any industrial interest. Reports of low-temperature growth of carbon nanotubes have mostly resulted in false dawns in the context of CMOS production, with direct integration for mass manufacturing remaining a challenge, as lower synthesis temperatures matched to manufacturing result in nanotubes with high defect levels. We report a unique ‘top-down' synthesis method that allows energy delivery directly to the catalyst, resulting in higher quality nanotube growth at compatible low substrate temperatures. This growth is demonstrated over a large-area, whilst maintaining the silicon substrate below 350 C. Long-range ordering of carbon nanotubes is supported by well developed second-order Raman peaks and HREM. The methodology developed is suitable to produce many nano-material systems, including graphene and silicon nanowires.},

From macrokinetic experiments conducted at 450–503°C, the rate constants of MWCNTs oxidation and the parameters of the Arrhenius equation were determined. The oxidation intensity depends on the concentration and nature of the oxygen-containing surface groups. In fact, their thermal decomposition enhances the oxidation rate since frees the surface sites becoming additional active centers of the reaction.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility of using the longitudinal component of gold nanorod's surface plasmon resonance in biomolecular sensing. The sensitive dependence of the absorption maximum on the dielectric constant of the particle interfacial region makes gold nanorods a promise for constructing a biomolecular sensing scheme. The sensor containing gold nanorods, with a mean aspect ratio of 5.2, exhibits a sensitivity of ca. 366 nm/RIU (refractive index unit), which increases accordingly with the increase of the particle mean aspect ratios. Such a biosensor was further modified to demonstrate its effectiveness in quantitative detection for selective binding events, such as biotin/streptavidin pairs, through a process in which biotin molecules were chemically attached to the gold nanorods' surface prior to detection measurements. Results showed that the spectral $\lambda$max shifts linearly to the concentrations of the streptavidin. The results from both experiment and model calculations strongly indicate the efficacy of the longitudinal surface plasmon absorption band in biosensing. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes have been proposed to be good one-dimensional conductors. However, the finite curvature of the graphene sheet that forms the nanotubes and the broken symmetry due to the local environment may modify their electronic properties. We used low-temperature atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate zigzag and armchair nanotubes, both thought to be metallic. "Metallic" zigzag nanotubes were found to have energy gaps with magnitudes that depend inversely on the square of the tube radius, whereas isolated armchair tubes do not have energy gaps. Additionally, armchair nanotubes packed in bundles have pseudogaps, which exhibit an inverse dependence on tube radius. These observed energy gaps suggest that most "metallic" single-walled nanotubes are not true metals, and they have implications for our understanding of the electronic properties and potential applications of carbon nanotubes.},

The AuNTs decorated nanoporous polycarbonate (AuNTs-PC) template as biosensor electrode was fabricated by electrodeposition method. The single strand DNA (ss-DNA) probe was covalently immobilized onto the AuNTs-PC electrode. The hybridization of target sequences with the ss-DNA probe was observed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The biosensor showed high selectivity and could differentiate between the complementary, mismatch and non-complementary DNA sequences. The EIS measurements were matched to Randle's equivalent circuit. The negatively-charged HPV DNA oligonucleotides under external electric field were oriented in a preferred direction and the bio-sensing responses were intensified by controlling the immobilization and hybridization of the sequences on the AuNTs surface. The fabricated DNA biosensor under electric field amplification was stable up to six weeks and demonstrated 97% of its initial detection responses. The biosensor displayed the HPV DNA hybridization detection in very low concentrations in the linear response ranges of 0.01 pM–1 $\mu$M and was able to acquire a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 fM.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the nature of heat pulse propagation through a Y-junction carbon nanotube consisting of a (14,0) trunk splitting into a pair of (7,0) branches. For comparison, these simulations were also carried out on straight (7,0) and (14,0) carbon nanotubes. Simulations of the Y-junction nanotube were run in three different configurations: with the heat pulse originating in the trunk, in one of the branches, or in both of the branches simultaneously. All of the simulations were run at OK, and the length of the pulse was 1ps. Results have shown that the heat pulse excites a variety of traveling phonon modes. It has been found that the junction impedes the propagation of these modes. Furthermore, it has been observed that traveling modes originating in the trunk pass through the junction more easily than those originating in the branches. This provides preliminary evidence for anisotropic heat flow in Y-junction nanotube structures at low temperatures. Finally, it is possible for a single phonon mode passing through the junction to generate multiple phonon modes on the other side, all with velocities less than or equal to the original mode.},

In this paper, we perform an extensive study of the impacts of high temperature exposure on the structural and mechanical properties of BNNTs with a full structural size spectrum from nano- to micro- to macro-scale by using a variety of in situ and ex situ material characterization techniques. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that the structures of individual BNNTs can survive at up to 850 °C in air and capture the signs of their structural degradation at 900 °C or above. In situ Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that the BN bonds in BNNT micro-fibrils undergo substantial softening at elevated temperatures of up to 900 °C. The AFM-based nanomechanical compression measurements demonstrate that the mechanical integrity of individual BNNTs remain intact after being thermally baked at up to 850 °C in air. The studies reveal that BNNTs are structurally and mechanically stable materials in high temperature environments, which enables their usages in high temperature applications.},

abstract = {Graphene oxide (GO) with various degrees of oxidation was synthesized using a modified Hummers method. The formation of different types of oxygen containing functional groups in GO, and their influences on its structure were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), zeta potential analysis and Raman spectroscopy. XRD studies showed a disruption of the graphitic AB stacking order during the increase in oxidation levels. XPS analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at lower oxidation levels and epoxide groups at higher oxidation levels. The influence of the oxidation degree on the properties of GO was evaluated by zeta potential analysis, which showed a linear increase in the zeta potential with increasing oxidation levels. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that increasing oxidation levels results in a transition from a crystalline to an amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of GO is highly influenced by the variation in degree of oxidation. Our results suggest that the properties of GO can be tuned by varying the oxidation degree, which may pave the way to new developments in the GO-based applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The temperature acquisition circuit in system adopted Pt1000 resistance thermometer as temperature sensor. Through this acquisition circuit, the monitoring actual temperature signal could be converted into voltage signal and transmitted into MCU. A TLP521-1 photoelectric coupler was matched with BD237 power transistor to drive the thermoelectric cooler (TEC) in FTA951 module. The effective electric power of TEC was controlled by the pulse width modulation (PWM) signals which generated by MCU. The PWM signal parameters could be adjusted timely by PID algorithm according to the difference between monitoring actual temperature and set temperature.

Lead underpotential deposition (UPD) reveals that the surface of the nanorods is composed by (111) and (110) domains, while (100) domains are practically absent from the surface. In the case of the oxygen reduction reaction, the formation of hydrogen peroxide as a final product of the reaction in the whole potential range also indicates that (100) domains are absent on the surface of the nanoparticles, corroborating the previous result.

abstract = {The photothermal properties of solid and hollow gold nanostructures represented by colloidal solutions of spherical nanoparticles, nanoshells, and nanocages upon irradiation with a 100 mW 808 nm continuous-wave laser for the first time were experimentally compared under identical optical density and nanoparticle concentration conditions. Accompanying computer modeling of light absorption by the studied gold nanostructures revealed the general parameters influencing the photothermal efficiency, which is of significance for nanomedical applications. The spectral position of localized plasmonic excitations of the studied nanostructures ranged from 518 nm for solid gold nanoparticles to 718 nm for gold nanocages, which provided a possibility to observe a direct influence of the wavelength proximity between the localized surface plasmon resonance and laser line on the heat generation capability of the nanostructures. As a result, the best photothermal efficiency was registered for gold nanocages, which proves them as an efficient photothermal treatment agent and a possible candidate to build a nanocarrier platform for drug delivery with a controlled release. Light absorption modeling demonstrated an existence of optimal wall thickness for gold nanoshells that should lead to the maximum photothermal efficiency when irradiated with 808 nm light, which varied from about 0.1 to 0.4 in units of external nanoshell radius with an increase of the wall porosity. Additionally, computer modeling results show that increased wall porosity should lead to enhanced photothermal efficiency of polydisperse colloidal solutions of hollow gold nanostructures.},

We show that the electronic properties of a semiconducting (8, 4) CNT can be modified by small amounts of Pd adatoms. Such a decoration conserves the piezoelectric properties of the CNT. Besides the electronic influence, the stability of a single adatom, which is of big importance for future technology applications, is investigated as well. We find only small energy barriers for the diffusion of a Pd adatom on the CNT surface. Thus, single Pd adatoms will be mobile at room temperature. Finally we present results for the interaction between a metallic (6, 0) CNT and metal surfaces. Binding energies and distances for Al, Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au are discussed and compared, showing remarkable agreement between the interaction of single metal atoms and metal surfaces with CNTs.},

abstract = {Adsorption of Li and Na on pristine and defective graphene and graphene oxide (GO) is studied using density functional theory (DFT) structural and electronic calculations, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and electron localization function (ELF) analyses. DFT calculations show that Li and Na adsorptions on pristine graphene are not stable at all metal coverages examined here. However, the presence of defects on graphene support stabilizes both Li and Na adsorptions. Increased Li and Na coverages cause metal nucleation and weaken adsorption. Defective graphene is associated with the presence of band gaps and, thus, Li and Na adsorptions can be used to tune these gaps. Electronic calculations show that Li– and Na–graphene interactions are Coulombic: as Li and Na coverages increase, the metal valences partially hybridize with the graphene bands and weaken metal–graphene support interactions. However, for Li adsorption on single vacancy graphene, QTAIM, ELF, and overlap populations calculations show that the Li-C bond has some covalent character. The Li and Na adsorptions on GO are significantly stronger than on graphene and strengthen upon increased coverages. This is due to Li and Na forming bonds with both carbon and oxygen GO atoms. QTAIM and ELF are used to analyze the metal–C and metal–metal bonds (when metal nucleation is present). The Li and Na clusters may contain both covalent and metallic intra metal–metal bonds: This effect is related to the adsorption support selection. ELF bifurcation diagrams show individual metal–C and metal–metal interactions, as Li and Na are adsorbed on graphene and GO, at the metal coverages examined here.},

abstract = {Gold nanotubes array has been synthesized by direct electrodeposition with cyclic voltammetry utilizing anodic aluminum oxide template (AAO). The morphological characterizations of the gold nanotubes prepared with different electrodepositing time have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results shows that as electrodepositing time increased, the inner diameter of gold nanotubes become smaller. An amperometric immunosensor for determination of human serum chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) was constructed by immobilizing hCG antibody (anti-hCG) onto gold nanotubes array. The fabricated procedures and electrochemical behaviors of proteins on such an interface were characterized with electrochemical impedance, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Effects of electrodepositing time of gold nanotubes on the amperometric response of experimental measurements and other experimental conditions such as pH, incubation time and temperature were studied and the optimal pH, incubation time and temperature were 6.9, 40min, 33°C, respectively. The resulting immunosensor offers an excellent amperometric response for hCG ranging from 0.1 to 100mIUmL-1 and the detection limit of 0.08mIUmL-1 with the correlation coefficient of 0.991. The immunosensor shows satisfactory regeneration, stability and selectivity. A satisfactory determination of hCG in serum samples can be obtained by this immunosensor. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@phdthesis{Luo2008,
abstract = {The key to understanding and predicting the behavior of materials is the knowledge of their structures. Many properties of materials samples are not solely determined by their average chemical compositions which one may easily control. Instead, they are profoundly influenced by structural features of different characteristic length scales. Starting in the last century, metallurgical engineering has mostly been microstructure engineering. With the further evolution of materials science, structural features of smaller length scales down to the atomic structure, have become of interest for the purpose of properties engineering and functionalizing materials and are, therefore, subjected to study. As computer modeling is becoming more powerful due to the dramatic increase of computational resources and software over the recent decades, there is an increasing demand for atomistic simulations with the goal of better understanding materials behavior on the atomic scale. Density functional theory (DFT) is a quantum mechanics based approach to calculate electron distribution, total energy and interatomic forces with high accuracy. From these, atomic structures and thermal effects can be predicted. However, DFT is mostly applied to relatively simple systems because it is computationally very demanding. In this thesis, the current limits of DFT applications are explored by studying relatively complex systems, namely, carbynes, carbon nanotube (CNT) devices and bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Special care is taken to overcome the limitations set by small system sizes and time scales that often prohibit DFT from being applied to realistic systems under realistic external conditions. In the first study, we examine the possible existence of a third solid phase of carbon with linear bonding called carbyne, which has been suggested in the literature and whose formation has been suggested to be detrimental to high-temperature carbon materials. We have suggested potential structures for solid carbynes based on literature data and our calculations and have calculated their free energies by DFT as a function of temperature (0 – 4000 K) and pressure (0-180 kbar). We propose and verify a simplified approach to calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) to allow a fast calculation of free energies. We found that all carbyne structures have higher free energies than graphite in the whole temperature and pressure range of this investigation, making pure (carbon-only) carbynes at most meta-stable. The inclusion of impurities was studied as well and may be the key for a stable carbyne phase. For CNT devices which have been suggested to eventually replace current Si technology, there is currently no equivalent for the highly used Si process modeling methods (“Technology Computer Aided Design” (TCAD)). We suggest accelerated DFT molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a method for process modeling and apply it to study the contact formation between CNTs and metal contacts consisting of Ti, Pd, Al, and Au. The temperature accelerated dynamics (TAD) technique was adopted to overcome the time limitations of MD simulations in general, which are especially severe for the computationally demanding DFT MD simulations. We found that CNTs undergo a structural transformation when brought into contact with certain metal electrodes (here, Ti and Al). This resulted in a dramatic decrease in electrical conductance of the device. We also show that the transformation depends on the size of CNTs due to the sizedependent elastic energy and on the electrode materials due to the electronegativitydependent charge transfer. In the last study, DFT was used in conjunction with classical MD simulations to predict the electron density of a Cu46Zr54 BMG structure modeled by a 1000-atom cell. Whereas DFT is capable to calculate the electron distribution in the cell, it is too slow to simulate melting and structural relaxation, which we handle by classical MD within the Embedded Atom Method. We propose a new model to analyze the open volume distribution based on the electron density and compare it with the traditional hard sphere model. Results from both models agree well, while the former allows a significantly better physical insight into the open volume distribution. As an additional plus, its results can be connected to experimental results by techniques such as Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS).},

For tubes with diameters less than about 10 {\AA}the optimum position of the ion is in the center of the tube. Bader analysis and an analysis of the densities of states gave contradictory results for the charge on the halide ions, but we argue on physical grounds that they carry unit negative charge. We have calculated the energies of inserting the atoms into the tubes, where they are ionized. Because of the small system size the work function of the tubes changes during this process, which makes it difficult to interpret these energies. The surrounding tubes screen the ionic charge very effectively; thereby the ion-ion interactions are strongly reduced, which explains, why narrow tubes store charge more effectively than wider one. These effects are stronger for gold than for graphite tubes. We define an effective image radius of a cylindrical tube, and calculate the image energy experienced by the ions.},

abstract = {We present a method to perform fully selfconsistent density-functional calculations, which scales linearly with the system size and which is well suited for very large systems. It uses strictly localized pseudoatomic orbitals as basis functions. The sparse Hamiltonian and overlap matrices are calculated with an $O(N)$ effort. The long range selfconsistent potential and its matrix elements are computed in a real-space grid. The other matrix elements are directly calculated and tabulated as a function of the interatomic distances. The computation of the total energy and atomic forces is also done in $O(N)$ operations using truncated, Wannier-like localized functions to describe the occupied states, and a band-energy functional which is iteratively minimized with no orthogonality constraints. We illustrate the method with several examples, including carbon and silicon supercells with up to 1000 Si atoms and supercells of $\beta$-C$_3$N$_4$. We apply the method to solve the existing controversy about the faceting of large icosahedral fullerenes by performing dynamical simulations on C$_{60}$, C$_{240}$, and C$_{540}$.},

The TEM results showed that the average diameter of gold nanotubes was 72 nm and length up to 4-7 µm.

One important limitation of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is, however, its poor time resolution. Recording a standard image with a STM typically takes about a fraction of a second for a fast scanning STM to several tens of seconds for a standard STM. The time resolution of a STM can, however, be significantly enhanced by at least several orders of magnitude. Here various methods are reviewed that are applied in order to significantly improve the time resolution of STM. These methods include high-speed or video STM, atom-tracking STM, and monitoring of the open feedback loop current or closed feedback loop z -piezo-voltage signals as a function of time.

abstract = {Using FreeRTOS and libopencm3 instead of the Arduino software environment, this book will help you develop multi-tasking applications that go beyond Arduino norms. In addition to the usual peripherals found in the typical Arduino device, the STM32 device includes a USB controller, RTC (Real Time Clock), DMA (Direct Memory Access controller), CAN bus and more. Each chapter contains clear explanations of the STM32 hardware capabilities to help get you started with the device, including GPIO and several other ST Microelectronics peripherals like USB and CAN bus controller. You'll learn how to download and set up the libopencm3 + FreeRTOS development environment, using GCC. With everything set up, you'll leverage FreeRTOS to create tasks, queues, and mutexes. You'll also learn to work with the I2C bus to add GPIO using the PCF8574 chip. And how to create PWM output for RC control using hardware timers. You'll be introduced to new concepts that are necessary to master the STM32, such as how to extend code with GCC overlays using an external Winbond W25Q32 flash chip. Your knowledge is tested at the end of each chapter with exercises. Upon completing this book, you'll be ready to work with any of the devices in the STM32 family.

abstract = {A novel class of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based nanomaterials has been surging since 1991 due to their noticeable mechanical and electrical properties, as well as their good electron transport properties. This is evidence that the development of CNT-reinforced polymer composites could contribute in expanding many areas of use, from energy-related devices to structural components. As a promising material with a wide range of applications, their poor solubility in aqueous and organic solvents has hindered the utilizations of CNTs. The current state of research in CNTs-both singlewall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-reinforced polymer composites-was reviewed in the context of the presently employed covalent and non-covalent functionalization. As such, this overview intends to provide a critical assessment of a surging class of composite materials and unveil the successful development associated with CNT-incorporated polymer composites. The mechanisms related to the mechanical, thermal, and electrical performance of CNT-reinforced polymer composites is also discussed. It is vital to understand how the addition of CNTs in a polymer composite alters the microstructure at the micro- and nano-scale, as well as how these modifications influence overall structural behavior, not only in its as fabricated form but also its functionalization techniques. The technological superiority gained with CNT addition to polymer composites may be advantageous, but scientific values are here to be critically explored for reliable, sustainable, and structural reliability in different industrial needs.},

abstract = {A method for calculating approximately the coupling energy of weakly interacting fragments is presented. The method is a simplified version of the density-functional scheme of Kohn and Sham and is applicable whenever the electron density of the coupled fragments does not deviate too markedly from a sum of isolated fragment densities. The coupling energy is expressed directly in terms of properties of the isolated fragments and the only nontrivial computational step is the deter- mination of an eigenvalue sum for the coupled system with a fixed potential. Neither self- consistency cycling nor a solution of Poisson's equation for the coupled fragments is required. The method is therefore particularly appropriate when full density-functional calculations are tractable for the isolated fragments but difficult for the coupled system, e.g., a molecule interacting with a surface. Explicit calculations for dimers illustrate that the approach is very accurate for weakly in- teracting systems, and that reasonable results can be obtained even for strong covalent bonds},

abstract = {A review of the present status, recent enhancements, and applicability of the Siesta program is presented. Since its debut in the mid-1990s, Siesta's flexibility, efficiency, and free distribution have given advanced materials simulation capabilities to many groups worldwide. The core methodological scheme of Siesta combines finite-support pseudo-atomic orbitals as basis sets, norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and a real-space grid for the representation of charge density and potentials and the computation of their associated matrix elements. Here, we describe the more recent implementations on top of that core scheme, which include full spin-orbit interaction, non-repeated and multiple-contact ballistic electron transport, density functional theory (DFT)+U and hybrid functionals, time-dependent DFT, novel reduced-scaling solvers, density-functional perturbation theory, efficient van der Waals non-local density functionals, and enhanced molecular-dynamics options. In addition, a substantial effort has been made in enhancing interoperability and interfacing with other codes and utilities, such as wannier90 and the second-principles modeling it can be used for, an AiiDA plugin for workflow automatization, interface to Lua for steering Siesta runs, and various post-processing utilities. Siesta has also been engaged in the Electronic Structure Library effort from its inception, which has allowed the sharing of various low-level libraries, as well as data standards and support for them, particularly the PSeudopotential Markup Language definition and library for transferable pseudopotentials, and the interface to the ELectronic Structure Infrastructure library of solvers. Code sharing is made easier by the new open-source licensing model of the program. This review also presents examples of application of the capabilities of the code, as well as a view of on-going and future developments.},

abstract = {The optical properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes are very promising for developing novel opto-electronic components and sensors with applications in many fields. Despite numerous studies performed using photoluminescence or Raman and Rayleigh scattering, knowledge of their optical response is still partial. Here we determine using spatial modulation spectroscopy, over a broad optical spectral range, the spectrum and amplitude of the absorption cross-section of individual semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes. These quantitative measurements permit determination of the oscillator strength of the different excitonic resonances and their dependencies on the excitonic transition and type of semiconducting nanotube. A non-resonant background is also identified and its cross-section comparable to the ideal graphene optical absorbance. Furthermore, investigation of the same single-wall nanotube either free standing or lying on a substrate shows large broadening of the excitonic resonances with increase of oscillator strength, as well as stark weakening of polarization-dependent antenna effects, due to nanotube-substrate interaction.},

The substitutional doping of nitrogen atoms can change the electronic structure of graphyne, which is beneficial to the adsorption of Li atoms. The results show that isolate Li atom is preferred to locate hollow site above the center of the acetylenic ring with binding energies more than 3.10 eV. A maximum of three hydrogen molecules can bind to Li atom decorated graphyne on one side. The average binding energy per H2 molecule for Li-decorated nitrogen-substituted graphyne is higher than that of pure graphyne.},

With recent rapid developments in optics and nanotechnology, plasmonic materials have potential in cancer diagnosis and treatment, but there are some concerns regarding their clinical use. The primary concerns include the design of plasmonic nanomaterials which are taken up by the tissues, perform their function and then clear out from the body. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) can be developed in different morphologies and functionalized to assist the photothermal therapy in a way that they have clinical value. This review outlines the diverse Au morphologies, their distinctive characteristics, concerns and limitations to provide an idea of the requirements in the field of NIR-based therapeutics.},

Theoretical calculations indicated one light scattering peak occurs in visible region. Furthermore, with increasing the gold wall thickness, this scattering peak blue shifts and increases nonlinearly.

Calculations of the dielectric function and optical absorption of the isolated nanotubes were performed under light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the tube axis. We compare our results to measurements of the optical absorption of zeolite-grown nanotubes and are able to assign the observed maxima to the nanotube chiralities.},

abstract = {Binder-free polymer encapsulated nano sulfur/super-aligned CNT (PVP@S-SACNT) composite electrode is developed via a solution-based method. In the composite structure, PVP not only facilitates better dispersion of SACNT bundles into a 3D continuous network, but also encapsulates the sulfur nanoparticles onto the SACNT network to ensure their tight electrical connection and prevent polysulfide dissolution. Combining the advantages of the high conductive and porous SACNT network and the PVP surface modification, the PVP@S-SACNT cathode exhibits excellent cyclic stability (initial capacity of 1303 mA h g-1 and 856 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 1 C) and high-rate performance (590 mA h g-1 at 20 C). Moreover, the PVP@S-SACNT composite presents excellent long-term capacity stability with a capacity decay of 0.052% per cycle during 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 2 C. With these appealing performances, the PVP@S-SACNT composite becomes a promising cathode material for the next-generation rechargeable batteries.},

abstract = {The lithium absorption energy of carbon nanotubes and the nature of local LiC and CC chemical bondings have been investigated using first-principles molecular orbital methods. The Li absorption energy was found to be larger outside the nanotube than inside the nanotube when the nanotube diameter is small. However, the Li outside-absorption energy decreases with the nanotube diameter, whereas the Li inside-absorption energy increases. When the nanotube diameter increases beyond approximately 0.824 nm, the Li outside-absorption energy tends to reach a value similar to the Li inside-absorption energy. The absorption of Li both inside and outside carbon nanotubes remains energetically favorable. In addition, the present study reveals the distinctive chemical interactions between Li and C atoms and between C atoms due to the curvature of carbon sheet in Li absorbed carbon nanotubes, which is obviously different from that of Li absorption into graphite. {\textcopyright} 2003.},

The catalytic activity of defective, oxygen-functionalized CNTs (dCNTs) is much better than bare CNTs, which stems from many active sites on the CNT surface, including structural defects and carbonyl functional groups, and excellent electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the effect of several operational factors and water conditions on the degradation rate of the targeted pollutant and material stability are comprehensively evaluated for the practical application of the dCNT/PMS-coupled process. The underlying catalytic mechanism in dCNTs is expected to take place via nonradical pathway and radical-induced oxidation where surface-bound radicals play a more dominant role than free radicals. The defect and oxygen functional group tuning strategy provides an effective methodology for the development of advanced carbon catalysts in Fenton-like reactions.},

Carbon nanotubes provide high-performance channels below 10 nanometers, but as with silicon, the increase in contact resistance with decreasing size becomes a major performance roadblock. We report a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) transistor technology with an end-bonded contact scheme that leads to size-independent contact resistance to overcome the scaling limits of conventional side-bonded or planar contact schemes. A high-performance SWNT transistor was fabricated with a sub-10-nanometer contact length, showing a device resistance below 36 kilohms and on-current above 15 microampere per tube. The p-type end-bonded contact, formed through the reaction of molybdenum with the SWNT to form carbide, also exhibited no Schottky barrier. This strategy promises high-performance SWNT transistors, enabling future ultimately scaled device technologies.},

abstract = {Exposing single-walled carbon nanotubes to room-temperature UV-generated ozone leads to an irreversible increase in their electrical resistance. We demonstrate that the increased resistance is due to ozone oxidation on the sidewalls of the nanotubes rather than at the end caps. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies show an increase in the defect density due to the oxidation of the nanotubes. Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, we show that these defects represent the removal of $\pi$-conjugated electron states near the Fermi level, leading to the observed increase in electrical resistance. Oxidation of carbon nanotubes is an important first step in many chemical functionalization processes. Because the oxidation rate can be controlled with short exposures, UV-generated ozone offers the potential for use as a low-thermal-budget processing tool. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

On the other hand, polystyrene spheres can be deposited as ordered monolayers to create patterned PDMS films with well-defined light diffraction. Both effects were used to monitor the structural damageof such PDMS films upon stretching, remaining both physical phenomena (absorption from the gold film and diffraction from the ordered structure) active for optical sensing applications in the early detection of structural damage in critical infrastructures.},

abstract = {This study establishes a generic fitting approach to assignment of nanotube chiralities based on radial breathing mode frequencies (omega (RBM)) of SWCNTs in as-produced bundles. Four laser lines with energies of 2.62 eV, 2.33 eV, 1.88 eV and 1.58 eV were employed. The observed RBM frequencies, omega (RBM), were plotted as a function of the possible diameters, d, as identified from the so-called Kataura plot and reported values of the parameters A and B, where omega (RBM)=A/d+B, assuming that SWCNTs resonant at the respective laser frequencies dominate the spectrum. The refined values of A and B, obtained by the best fit of a linear regression between omega (RBM) and 1/d, were found to vary significantly for different laser frequencies. This variation is interpreted in terms of the differences in electronic properties of SWCNTs resonant at different frequencies. The assigned nanotubes match well with those identified in the Kataura plot, falling within a resonant line width of +/- 0.2 eV of the respective laser lines.},

abstract = {That wonderful production of the human mind, the undulatory theory of light, with the phenomena for which it strives to account, seems to me, who am only an experimentalist, to stand midway between what we may conceive to be the coarser mechanical actions of matter, with their explanatory philosophy, and that other branch which includes, or should include, the physical idea of forces acting at a distance; and admitting for the time, the existence of the ether, I have often struggled to perceive how far that medium might account for or mingle in with such actions, generally; and to what extent experimental trials might be devised which, with their results and consequences, might contradict, confirm, enlarge, or modify the idea we form of it, always with the hope that the corrected or instructed idea would approach more and more to the truth of nature, and in the fulness of time coincide with it. The phenomena of light itself are, however, the best and closest tests at present of the undulatory theory; and if that theory is hereafter to extend to and include other actions, the most effectual means of enabling it to do so will be to render its application to its own special phenomena clear and sufficient. At present the most instructed persons are, I suppose, very far from perceiving the full and close coincidence between all the facts of fight and the physical account of them which the theory supplies. If perfect, the theory would be able to give a reason for every physical affection of fight; whilst it does not do so, the affections are in turn fitted to develope the theory, to extend and enlarge it if true, or if in error to correct it or replace it by a better. Hence my plea for the possible utility of experiments and considerations such as those I am about to advance.},

@article{Dovesi2018,
abstract = {The latest release of the Crystal program for solid-state quantum-mechanical ab initio simulations is presented. The program adopts atom-centered Gaussian-type functions as a basis set, which makes it possible to perform all-electron as well as pseudopotential calculations. Systems of any periodicity can be treated at the same level of accuracy (from 0D molecules, clusters and nanocrystals, to 1D polymers, helices, nanorods, and nanotubes, to 2D monolayers and slab models for surfaces, to actual 3D bulk crystals), without any artificial repetition along nonperiodic directions for 0–2D systems. Density functional theory calculations can be performed with a variety of functionals belonging to several classes: local-density (LDA), generalized-gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, global hybrid, range-separated hybrid, and self-consistent system-specific hybrid. In particular, hybrid functionals can be used at a modest computational cost, comparable to that of pure LDA and GGA formulations, because of the efficient implementation of exact nonlocal Fock exchange. Both translational and point-symmetry features are fully exploited at all steps of the calculation, thus drastically reducing the corresponding computational cost. The various properties computed encompass electronic structure (including magnetic spin-polarized open-shell systems, electron density analysis), geometry (including full or constrained optimization, transition-state search), vibrational properties (frequencies, infrared and Raman intensities, phonon density of states), thermal properties (quasi-harmonic approximation), linear and nonlinear optical properties (static and dynamic [hyper]polarizabilities), strain properties (elasticity, piezoelectricity, photoelasticity), electron transport properties (Boltzmann, transport across nanojunctions), as well as X-ray and inelastic neutron spectra. The program is distributed in serial, parallel, and massively parallel versions. In this paper, the original developments that have been devised and implemented in the last 4 years (since the distribution of the previous public version, Crystal14, occurred in December 2013) are described. This article is categorized under: Software > Quantum Chemistry Structure and Mechanism > Computational Materials Science Electronic Structure Theory > Density Functional Theory.},

abstract = {Fabrication of the new composite materials with improved mechanical characteristics is of high interest nowadays. Simulation methods can considerably improve understanding of the interaction between the graphene and metal phase, even in the atomistic level. In the present work, the simulation of graphene-metal composites by molecular dynamics is reviewed. Both experiments and simulation results have shown that the metal matrix can be reinforced with graphene flakes, and the overall mechanical properties of the final composite structure can be significantly improved. Two basic types of metal-graphene composite structures are considered: (i) metal matrix strengthens by graphene flakes and (ii) crumpled graphene (the porous structure that consists of crumpled graphene flakes connected by van der Waals forces) as the matrix for metal nanoparticles. Several different types of interatomic potentials like pairwise Lennard-Jones or Morse or complex bond order potentials for the description of metal-carbon interaction are presented and discussed. It is shown that even simple interatomic potentials can be effectively used for the molecular dynamics simulation of graphene-metal composites. Particular attention is paid to graphene-Ni composites obtained by deformation and heat treatment from crumpled graphene with pores filled with Ni nanoparticles. It is shown, that high-temperature compression can be effectively used for the fabrication of the graphene-Ni composite with improved mechanical properties.},

The effect of trigonal warping on the energy dispersion relations near the Fermi energy splits the peaks of the density of states for metallic nanotubes, and the magnitude of this effect depends on the chiral angle of the carbon nanotube. The width of the peak splitting has a maximum for metallic zigzag nanotubes, and no splitting is obtained for armchair nanotubes or semiconducting nanotubes. We also find an additional logarithmic singularity in the electronic DOS for carbon nanotubes that is related to a two-dimensional singularity, which does not depend on either the diameter or the chirality.},

The Li-nanotube interaction perpendicular to the tube axis for a single Li inside and outside the tube is calculated and compared with the Li-graphene interaction obtained using the same technique. Both interactions are similar in the repulsive region but exhibit differences in their attractive part. Nevertheless, they can be described using a common parametrization. The Li-Li interaction is calculated as a function of their separation inside the tube. This interaction is similar to a screened repulsive Coulomb potential at small separations. However, at larger separations, the Li-Li interaction does not vanish and shows residual oscillations. This repulsive long-ranged interaction favors concerted diffusion of many Li atoms compared to the independent diffusion of individual Li inside the tube},

abstract = {The application of electroless plating to porous template membranes displays an important route towards one-dimensional metal nanostructures such as nanotubes. For this reaction class, activation pretreatments are required to introduce catalyst seeds, which initiate surface-selective metal deposition from the metastable plating baths. Hitherto, these pretreatments are performed as a means to an end to ensure reliable metal film nucleation, and introduce often undesired contaminations. In this work, we demonstrate that the seeding step can be recognized as a synthetic tool to purposefully adjust the chemical composition of electrolessly plated nanomaterials. By consecutive application of several interfacial reactions (polymer swelling, reducing agent absorption, metal nanoparticle nucleation, autocatalytic metal deposition), we fabricate gold-platinum nanotubes of well-defined composition. Aside strictly monometallic gold and platinum nanotubes, bimetallic nanotubes are produced which consist of platinum nanoparticles embedded in gold walls. As shown in the electrooxidation of formic acid, the nanotube composition has a pronounced impact on the properties of the resulting materials and can be used to enhance the catalyst performance. The outlined strategy provides a versatile route towards sets of compositionally varying metal nanostructures and allows to examine and to exploit multi-element synergies.},

The measured reversible lithium ion capacities of CNT-based anodes are considerably improved compared to the conventional graphite-based anodes. Additionally, the opened structure and enriched chirality of CNTs can help to improve the capacity and electrical transport in CNT-based LIBs. Therefore, the modification of CNTs and design of CNT structure provide strategies for improving the performance of CNT-based anodes. CNTs could also be assembled into free-standing electrodes without any binder or current collector, which will lead to increased specific energy density for the overall battery design. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of lithium ion intercalation and diffusion in CNTs, and the influence of different structures and morphologies on their performance as anode materials for LIBs.},

As the average bond length ⟨d⟩ increased, the spacings of the neighboring gold atoms modulated similarly to the Peierls transition. The maximum tensile force of a linear four-atom-chain was 0.91 nN and occurred at ⟨d⟩≈3.1 {\AA}. The electric conductances were then calculated using the recursion transfer-matrix method.

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes have been regarded since their discovery1 as potential molecular quantum wires. In the case of multi-wall nanotubes, where many tubes are arranged in a coaxial fashion, the electrical properties of individual tubes have been shown to vary strongly from tube to tube2,3, and to be characterized by disorder and localization4. Single-wall nanotubes5,6 (SWNTs) have recently been obtained with high yields and structural uniformity7. Particular varieties of these highly symmetric structures have been predicted to be metallic, with electrical conduction occurring through only two electronic modes8–10. Because of the structural symmetry and stiffness of SWNTs, their molecular wavefunctions may extend over the entire tube. Here we report electrical transport measurements on individual single-wall nanotubes that confirm these theoretical predictions. We find that SWNTs indeed act as genuine quantum wires. Electrical conduction seems to occur through well separated, discrete electron states that are quantum-mechanically coherent over long distance, that is at least from contact to contact (140nm). Data in a magnetic field indicate shifting of these states due to the Zeeman effect.},

@article{Fuzil2021,
abstract = {In this study, the potential of graphene oxide-alginate beads (GO-AB) as an adsorbent for bisphenol A (BPA) removal from aqueous solution was investigated. GO was first prepared via modified Hummers' techniques and an aerogel alginate bead with embedded GO was prepared using an extrusion dripping method, where calcium chloride was utilized as a curing agent. The physicochemical characteristics of GO-AB were investigated using XRD, FTIR, BET, TGA. The results revealed that crystal structure and the surface groups of GO and alginate were retained upon the formation of GO-AB. A batch adsorption testing was carried out as a function of pH (3, 7, and 9), contact time (up to 420 min) and initial concentration of BPA (50—200 mg{\textperiodcentered}L−1). The adsorption rate was typically faster at the beginning of the adsorption process and started to level off after 180 min. AB and GO-AB had better adsorption performances at neutral condition (pH 7) than alkaline and acidic environments due to repulsive electrostatic interaction between BPA and the adsorbent surface's charge. The sorption kinetic data was observed fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetics model (R2 > 0.98) and obeyed the Freundlich isotherm model adsorption behaviour compared to Langmuir. However, the RL value of Langmuir model is between 0 and 1, which implies a favourable adsorption process. The maximum BPA adsorption capacity for AB and GO-AB was found to be 250.00 and 384.62 mg{\textperiodcentered}g−1, respectively, indicating that GO-AB is a promising adsorbent for BPA removal from aqueous solution. In addition, the adsorption efficiency of GO-AB exhibited more than 80% in the six-consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles of experiments, further confirming the excellent reusability of GO-AB.},

We found that the Ti4 clusters can strongly interact with pristine graphene surface, and the interaction can be further enhanced when structural vacancies are introduced onto the graphene surface. Electronic properties of metal/graphene composites are also presented to show their highly spin polarized behaviors. The transport properties of systems are dependent on the applied bias voltage. Our results also indicate that the Ti4/graphene composite is a simple and typical model to study the interactive effects of metal clusters absorbed on graphene. The results of this work could help to design novel devices such as nanoelectrodes and magnetic sensors based on graphene.},

abstract = {The effect of surface functionalization on the ability and kinetics of lithium intercalation in carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles has been studied by comparing the dynamical behaviors of lithium (Li) ions in pristine and -NH2 functionalized CNTs via ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. It was observed that lithium intercalation has been achieved quickly for both the pristine and surface functionalized CNT bundle. Our calculations demonstrated for the first time that CNT functionalization improved the efficiency of lithium intercalation significantly at both low and high Li ion density. Moreover, we found that keeping the nanotubes apart with an appropriate distance and charging the battery at a rational rate were beneficial to achieve a high rate of lithium intercalation. Besides, the calculated adsorption energy curves indicated that the potential wells in the system of -NH2 functionalized CNT were deeper than that of the pristine CNT bundle by 0.74 eV, and a third energy minimum with a value of 2.64 eV existed at the midpoint of the central axis of the nanotube. Thus, it would be more difficult to remove Li ions from the nanotube interior after surface functionalization. The barrier for lithium diffusion in the interior of the nanotube is greatly decreased because of the surface functional groups. Based on these results, we would suggest to "damage" the nanotube by introducing defects at its sidewall in order to improve not only the capacity of surface functionalized CNTs but also the efficiency of lithium intercalation and deintercalation processes. Our results presented here are helpful in understanding the mechanism of lithium intercalation into nanotube bundles, which may potentially be applied in the development of CNT based electrodes.},

abstract = {The structure of as-grown and heat-treated pyrolytic carbon nanotubes (PCNTs) produced by hydrocarbon pyrolysis are discussed on the basis of a possible growth process. The structures are compared with those of nanotubes obtained by the arc method (ACNT; arc-formed carbon nanotubes). PCNTs, with and without secondary pyrolytic deposition (which results in diameter increase) are found to form during pyrolysis of benzene at temperatures ca. 1060 °C under hydrogen. PCNTs after heat treatment at above 2800 °C under argon exhibit have improved stability and can be studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The microstructures of PCNTs closely resemble those of vapor-grown carbon fibers (VGCFs). Some VGCFs that have micro-sized diameters appear to have nanotube inner cross-sections that have different mechanical properties from those of the outer pyrolytic sections. PCNTs initially appear to grow as ultra-thin graphene tubes with central hollow cores (diameter ca. 2 nm or more) and catalytic particles are not observed at the tip of these tubes. The secondary pyrolytic deposition, which results in characteristic thickening by addition of extra cylindrical carbon layers, appears to occur simultaneously with nanotube lengthening growth. After heat treatment, HRTEM studies indicate clearly that the hollow cores are closed at the ends of polygonized hemi-spherical carbon caps. The most commonly observed cone angle at the tip is generally ca. 20 °, which implies the presence of five pentagonal disclinations clustered near the tip of the hexagonal network. A structural model is proposed for PCNTs observed to have spindle-like shape and conical caps at both ends. Evidence is presented for the formation, during heat treatment, of hemi-toroidal rims linking adjacent concentric walls in PCNTs. A possible growth mechanism for PCNTs, in which the tip of the tube is the active reaction site, is proposed. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The physisorption of bisphenol A (BPA) on pristine and oxidized graphene was studied theoretically via calculations performed at the PBE-D3 level (including dispersion force corrections). Three stable conformations of BPA on graphene were found. A lying-down configuration was energetically favored because the presence of $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking and dispersion forces increased interactions. In addition, the adsorption of BPA on the edges of graphene oxide was enhanced when adsorption occurred on carboxyl and carbonyl groups, whereas the adsorption strength decreased when adsorption occurred on hydroxyl groups. The highest physisorption strength was obtained on the surface of graphene oxide due to the presence of $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking and dispersion forces (which provided the greatest contribution to the adsorption energy) as well as hydrogen bonds (which provided a smaller contribution), indicating that oxidized graphene is a better candidate than pristine graphene for BPA removal. On the other hand, an increase in electrophilicity was observed after the physisorption of BPA in all systems (with respect to graphene and BPA in their isolated forms), with the adsorbent acting as the electron acceptor. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations performed using the PM6 Hamiltonian showed that the adsorption of BPA on graphene is stable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {A variety of outstanding experimental results on the elucidation of the elastic properties of carbon nanotubes are fast appearing. These are based mainly on the techniques of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the Young's moduli of single-wall nanotube bundles and multi-walled nanotubes, prepared by a number of methods. These results are confirming the theoretical predictions that carbon nanotubes have high strength plus extraordinary flexibility and resilience. As well as summarising the most notable achievements of theory and experiment in the last few years, this paper explains the properties of nanotubes in the wider context of materials science and highlights the contribution of our research group in this rapidly expanding field. A deeper understanding of the relationship between the structural order of the nanotubes and their mechanical properties will be necessary for the development of carbon-nanotube-based composites. Our research to date illustrates a qualitative relationship between the Young's modulus of a nanotube and the amount of disorder in the atomic structure of the walls. Other exciting results indicate that composites will benefit from the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, but that the major outstanding problem of load transfer efficiency must be overcome before suitable engineering materials can be produced.},

Unlike infinite-length metallic nanotubes having universal energy dispersion relations near the Fermi level, the dispersion relations of finite-length ones can be classified into two kinds and their energy levels can be tailored by the length and diameter of the nanotube. Along a helical line or a line along the nanotube axis, the wave functions near the Fermi level appear periodic or keep constants. The standing-wave functions for an arbitrary metallic nanotube are also derived, from which an experimental method is suggested for measuring the chiral angle. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

Band structure, density of states and electronic charge density were calculated. CNTs (7, 7) show a metallic behavior and the electron charge densities of CNTs (7, 7) confirm a covalent bond between two carbon atoms.

Our work reveals that the electrochemical performance of KTiOPO4 as an anode for PIBs is superior to that for SIBs and LIBs, in terms of average voltage and ion diffusion kinetics. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the KTiOPO4Mx anode exhibits high structural stability, and alkali ion intercalation contributes to accelerating ion diffusion during the charging process. Particularly, the low activation energy of 0.406 eV of K migration on surface KTP(210), obtained by the climbing-image nudged elastic band method, suggests a high-rate capability. The systematical comparison of the performance of KTiOPO4 as an anode for PIBs, SIBs, and LIBs on the theoretical perspective clarifies that a large channel is not always promising for small radius ion intercalation and diffusion.},

abstract = {Dry-spun Carbon Nanotube (CNT) fibers were surface-modified by atmospheric pressure oxygen plasma functionalization using a well controlled and continuous process. The fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). It was found from the conducted electrochemical measurements that the functionalized fibers showed a 132.8% increase in specific capacitance compared to non-functionalized fibers. Dye-adsorption test and the obtained Randles-Sevcik plot demonstrated that the oxygen plasma functionalized fibers exhibited increased surface area. It was further established by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements that the surface area of the CNT fibers was increased from 168.22 m2/g to 208.01 m2/g after plasma functionalization. The pore size distribution of the fibers was also altered by this processing. The improved electrochemical data was attributed to enhanced wettability, increased surface area, and the presence of oxygen functional groups, which promoted the capacitance of the fibers. Fiber supercapacitors were fabricated from the oxygen plasma functionalized CNT fiber electrodes using different electrolyte systems. The devices with functionalized electrodes exhibited excellent cyclic stability (93.2% after 4000 cycles), flexibility, bendability, and good energy densities. At 0.5 mA/cm2, the EMIMBF4 device revealed a specific capacitance, which is 27% and 65% greater than the specific capacitances of devices using EMIMTFSI and H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively. The practiced in this work plasma surface processing can be employed in other applications where fibers, yarns, ribbons, and sheets need to be chemically modified.},

abstract = {We present an exact mapping of the Hubbard model in infinite dimensions onto a single-impurity Anderson (or Wolff) model supplemented by a self-consistency condition. This provides a mean-field picture of strongly corrrelated systems, which becomes exact as d. We point out a special integrable case of the mean-field equations, and study the general case using a perturbative renormalization group around the atomic limit. Three distinct Fermi-liquid regimes arise, corresponding to the Kondo, mixed-valence, and empty-orbitals regimes of the single-impurity problem. The Kondo resonance and the satellite peaks of the single-impurity model correspond to the quasiparticle and Hubbard-bands features of the Hubbard model, respectively. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

We observe nanotubes responding to uniform atom loss, through surface reconstruction and drastic dimensional changes. Experiments using electron irradiation evidence nanotube diameters shrinking from ∼1.4 to 0.4 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations show that surface reconstruction and size reduction occur through dangling bond saturation, forming nonhexagonal rings and 5-7 defects in the lattice. Nonuniform atom removal results in inhomogeneous tube deformations and local necking, and formation of linear atomic carbon chains in the nanotube body. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Kirchner-Hall2021,
abstract = {Accurate computational predictions of band gaps are of practical importance to the modeling and development of semiconductor technologies, such as (opto)electronic devices and pho-toelectrochemical cells. Among available electronic-structure methods, density-functional theory (DFT) with the Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) applied to band edge states is a computationally tractable approach to improve the accuracy of band gap predictions beyond that of DFT calculations based on (semi)local functionals. At variance with DFT approximations, which are not intended to describe optical band gaps and other excited-state properties, DFT+U can be interpreted as an approximate spectral-potential method when U is determined by imposing the piecewise linearity of the total energy with respect to electronic occupations in the Hubbard manifold (thus removing self-interaction errors in this subspace), thereby providing a (heuristic) justification for using DFT+U to predict band gaps. However, it is still frequent in the literature to determine the Hubbard U parameters semiempirically by tuning their values to reproduce experimental band gaps, which ultimately alters the description of other total-energy characteristics. Here, we present an extensive assessment of DFT+U band gaps computed using self-consistent ab initio U parameters obtained from density-functional perturbation theory to impose the aforementioned piecewise linearity of the total energy. The study is carried out on 20 compounds containing transition-metal or p-block (group III-IV) elements, including oxides, nitrides, sulfides, oxynitrides, and oxysulfides. By comparing DFT+U results obtained using nonorthogonalized and orthogonalized atomic orbitals as Hubbard projectors, we find that the predicted band gaps are extremely sensitive to the type of projector functions and that the orthogonalized projectors give the most accurate band gaps, in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. This work demonstrates that DFT+U may serve as a useful method for high-throughput workflows that require reliable band gap predictions at moderate computational cost.},

These nanowires and nanotubes were then utilised in a DNA detection assay. The top end of the nanowire/nanotube was selectively functionalised with a 20-base oligonucleotide with a C3 spacer thiol (probe strand) that is complementary to a sequence specifically associated with S. Aureus mastitis. Once functionalised with probe strand DNA, the nanowires/nanotubes were released by dissolving the polycarbonate membrane and are capable of biorecognition on the top end of the nanowire and electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide along their entire length. A gold disc electrode was modified with a 15-base oligonucleotide with a C3 spacer thiol (capture strand). The target, a 41 base oligonucleotide specific to S. Aureus mastitis, hybridises with both capture and probe oligonucleotides and brings the nanowires close to the electrode surface enabling the electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Semi-log plots of the pathogen DNA concentration vs. faradaic current are linear from 1 fM to 1 $\mu$M and aM concentrations can be detected without the need for molecular, e.g., PCR or NASBA, amplification.},

The results show that the binding energy for all cases is less than 103.24 kJ/mol (1.07 eV) without substantial modification of the electronic properties, indicating that the interaction occurs through a physical adsorption regime.

abstract = {We study the catalytic capability of unsupported single-walled helical gold nanotubes Au(5,3) by using density functional theory. We use the CO oxidation as a benchmark probe to gain insights into high catalytic activity of the gold nanotubes. The CO oxidation, catalyzed by the Au(5,3) nanotube, proceeds via a two-step mechanism, CO + O2 → CO2 +O and CO + O → CO2. The CO oxidation is initiated by the CO + O2 → OOCO → CO2 + O reaction with an activation barrier of 0.29 eV. On the reaction path, a peroxo-type O-O-CO intermediate forms. Thereafter, the CO + O → CO2 reaction proceeds along the reaction pathway with a very low barrier (0.03 eV). Note that the second reaction cannot be the starting point for the CO oxidation due to the energetically disfavored adsorption of free O2 on the gold nanotube. The high catalytic activity of the Au(5,3) nanotube can be attributed to the electronic resonance between electronic states of adsorbed intermediate species and Au atoms at the reaction site, particularly among the d states of Au atom and the antibonding 2$\pi$* states of C-O and O1-O2, concomitant with a partial charge transfer. The presence of undercoordinated Au sites and the strain inherent in the helical gold nanotube also play important roles. Our study suggests that the CO oxidation catalyzed by the helical gold nanotubes is likely to occur at the room temperature. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The permanence of general trend of Young's modulus changes is shown.},

abstract = {Ru catalyst confined within the channels of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is prepared by opening tube ends via mixed concentrated acid oxidation or catalytic oxidation, followed by filling via wet impregnation. The catalyst filling ratio is characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The defects and functional groups are detected and quantified by Raman, fourier transformer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and XPS. The results show that high catalyst filling efficiency (∼80%) can be achieved with catalytic oxidation pre-treatment. The acid oxidation process can introduce more oxygen-containing functional groups such carboxyl and phenol groups. Both FTIR and XPS provide evidence for functional groups removal during thermal treatment. The effects of the nanotube length distributions, defects and functional groups on filling efficiency have been discussed intensively. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Gold nanotube arrays of rough and porous wall has been synthesized by direct electrodeposition with cyclic voltammetry utilizing anodic aluminum oxide template (AAO) and polycarbonate membrane (PC) during short time (only 3 min and 2 min, respectively). The mechanism of the direct electrodeposition of gold nanotube arrays by cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been discussed. The morphological characterizations of the gold nanotube arrays have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was constructed by attaching gold nanotube arrays (using AAO) onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrochemical behavior of AA and UA at this modified electrode has been studied by CV and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The sensor offers an excellent response for AA and UA and the linear response range for AA and UA were 1.02 × 10 - 7-5.23 × 10 - 4 mol L - 1 and 1.43 × 10 - 7-4.64 × 10 - 4 mol L - 1, the detection limits were 1.12 × 10 - 8 mol L - 1 and 2.24 × 10 - 8 mol L - 1, respectively. This sensor shows good regeneration, stability and selectivity and has been used for the determination of AA and UA in real human urine and serum samples with satisfied results. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Important aspects in engineering gold nanoparticles for theranostic applications include the control of size, optical properties, cytotoxicity, biodistribution, and clearance. In this study, gold nanotubes with controlled length and tunable absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region have been exploited for applications as photothermal conversion agents and in vivo photoacoustic imaging contrast agents. A length-controlled synthesis has been developed to fabricate gold nanotubes (NTs) with well-defined shape (i.e., inner void and open ends), high crystallinity, and tunable NIR surface plasmon resonance. A coating of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) endows the nanotubes with colloidal stability and low cytotoxicity. The PSS-coated Au NTs have the following characteristics: i) cellular uptake by colorectal cancer cells and macrophage cells, ii) photothermal ablation of cancer cells using single wavelength pulse laser irradiation, iii) excellent in vivo photoacoustic signal generation capability and accumulation at the tumor site, iv) hepatobiliary clearance within 72 h postintravenous injection. These results demonstrate that these PSS-coated Au NTs have the ideal attributes to develop their potential as effective and safe in vivo imaging nanoprobes, photothermal conversion agents, and drug delivery vehicles. To the best of knowledge, this is the first in vitro and in vivo study of gold nanotubes.},

In the second part of this two-part review we focus on the application of CNTs as potential drug delivery systems via chemical functionalization of CNTs for exterior binding of therapeutic and biologically relevant molecules, and via encapsulation of these molecules within the inner cavities of CNTs. We review experimental results of CNT-mediated delivery of small molecules, DNA, proteins, and vaccines, and the potential of CNTs as matrices to support and stimulate neural growth. Last, we examine some toxicological and biocompatibility issues related to the use of CNTs as pharmaceutical excipients and discuss attributes that affect toxicity, such as structure (single-walled vs. multi-walled CNTs), length and aspect ratio, surface area, degree of aggregation, extent of oxidation, surface topology, bound functional group(s), and method of manufacturing.},

The results show that the Caryl-Xbridge-Caryl angles (X bridge = C(CH3)2, CH2, S, O) span a range greater than 14°. The dihedral angle between the planes of the hydroxyphenyl groups also varies according to the identity of the bridging group, varying from 67.24(2)° in S(p-C6H4OH) 2 to 85.82(4)° in C(CH3)2(p-C 6H4OH)2. In addition, the pitch angle, which more accurately describes the propeller-like nature of these bisphenolic compounds, varies from 39.88(3)° in S(p-C6H4OH) 2 to 59.62(7)° in C(CH3)2(p-C 6H4OH)2. Ab initio electronic structure calculations predict very similar bond lengths and angles to those observed crystallographically; however, the predicted dihedral angles and pitch angles are quite different, suggesting that these features are greatly influenced by crystal packing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Net atomic charges (NACs) are widely used in all chemical sciences to concisely summarize key information about the partitioning of electrons among atoms in materials. The objective of this article is to develop an atomic population analysis method that is suitable to be used as a default method in quantum chemistry programs irrespective of the kind of basis sets employed. To address this challenge, we introduce a new atoms-in-materials method with the following nine properties: (1) exactly one electron distribution is assigned to each atom, (2) core electrons are assigned to the correct host atom, (3) NACs are formally independent of the basis set type because they are functionals of the total electron distribution, (4) the assigned atomic electron distributions give an efficiently converging polyatomic multipole expansion, (5) the assigned NACs usually follow Pauling scale electronegativity trends, (6) NACs for a particular element have good transferability among different conformations that are equivalently bonded, (7) the assigned NACs are chemically consistent with the assigned atomic spin moments, (8) the method has predictably rapid and robust convergence to a unique solution, and (9) the computational cost of charge partitioning scales linearly with increasing system size. We study numerous materials as examples: (a) a series of endohedral C60 complexes, (b) high-pressure compressed sodium chloride crystals with unusual stoichiometries, (c) metal-organic frameworks, (d) large and small molecules, (e) organometallic complexes, (f) various solids, and (g) solid surfaces. Due to non-nuclear attractors, Bader's quantum chemical topology could not assign NACs for some of these materials. We show for the first time that the Iterative Hirshfeld and DDEC3 methods do not always converge to a unique solution independent of the initial guess, and this sometimes causes those methods to assign dramatically different NACs on symmetry-equivalent atoms. By using a fixed number of charge partitioning steps with well-defined reference ion charges, the DDEC6 method avoids this problem by always converging to a unique solution. These characteristics make the DDEC6 method ideally suited for use as a default charge assignment method in quantum chemistry programs.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are quasi one-dimensional nanostructures with unique eletrical prroperties that make them prime candidates for molecular electronics, which is certainly a most promising direction in nanotechnology. Early theoretical works predicted that the electronic properties of "ideal" carbon nanotubes depend on their diameter and chirality. However, carbon nanotubes are probably not as perfect as they were once thought to be. Defects such as pentagons, heptagons, vacancies, or dopant are found to modify drastically the electronic properties of these nanosystems. Irradiation processes can lead to interesting, highly defective nanostructures and also to the coalescence of nanotubes within a rope. The introduction of defects in the carbon network is thus an interesting way to tailor its intrinsic properties, to create new potential nanodevices. The aim of the present Acount is to investigate theoretically the effects of different types of defects on the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes, and to propose new potential applications in nanoelectronics.},

The new code uses self-consistent electron densities from a variety of electronic structure methods (pseudopotentials/plane-wave, FP-LAPW, local orbitals, etc.), and it can also build the promolecular density from the crystal geometry alone. As an example of the new code, intermolecular interactions in several molecular crystals are presented and analyzed. The connection with QTAIM studies is established and a reinterpretation of the NCI domains is given regarding the current knowledge of the field. The connection between NCI domains and intermolecular vibrations is made apparent, as well as the ability of the method to reveal the locality of bonding. {\textcopyright} This journal is the Owner Societies 2012.},

Using ethanol or methane as the feed gas, monodispersed Fe-Mo as the catalyst, and a superaligned carbon nanotube (CNT) film as the catalyst supporting frame, ultralong CNTs over 18.5 cm long were grown on Si substrates. The growth rate of the CNTs was more than 40 mum/s. No catalyst-related residual material was found on the substrates due to the use of a CNT film as the catalyst supporting frame, facilitating any subsequent fabrication of SWNT-based devices. Electrical transport measurements indicated that the electrical characteristics along a single ultralong SWNT were uniform. We also found that maintaining a spatially homogeneous temperature during the growth process was a critical factor for obtaining constant electrical characteristics along the length of the ultralong SWNTs.},

abstract = {A key requirement for wearable electronics is an adequate and sustainable power source. Accordingly, a self-powering unit that replaces rechargeable secondary batteries is a promising solution. However, to realize permanent, maintenance-free, and highly durable wearable electronics, stretchable self-powering units that can harvest and store energy should be developed. In this study, we developed a fully stretchable self-charging power unit that integrates a micro-supercapacitor and triboelectric nanogenerator using oxidized single-walled carbon nanotube/polymer electrodes. The fully stretchable micro-supercapacitor with oxidized single-walled carbon nanotube/polyvinylalcohol electrodes exhibited a double layer capacitance of 20 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2 and improved mechanical flexibility and stretchability over 10,000 cycles of stretching tests. A stretchable, polydimethylsiloxane-based current collector employing silver nanoparticles embedded with oxidized single-walled carbon nanotubes enabled the fully stretchable, freestanding-triboelectric-layer based nanogenerators to produce a maximum instantaneous power density of 84.4 mW m−2 under periodic and round-trip sliding of a Nylon fabric while stretching up to 40% without significant performance degradation. Furthermore, a micro-supercapacitor of fully stretchable self-charging power unit could be successfully charged by the nanogenerator from 0 to 2.2 V in 1200 s and powered commercial digital clock for approximately 10 s. These results demonstrate that stretchable polymer composites with oxidized single-walled carbon nanotubes are suitable electrodes and active materials for fully stretchable and self-powered wearable electronics.},

abstract = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes, both before (SWNTs) and after treatment (t-SWNTs) with acidified ammonium persulfate, were successfully used to adsorb bisphenol A (BPA) and 17$\beta$-estradiol (E2) from aqueous systems. The surface characteristics of the SWNTs and t-SWNTs were analyzed by measuring their surface charge and by imaging their morphological properties through transmission electron microscopy. The extent of defects on the SWNT scaffold generated through acid etching was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. A total of 19.4, 15.4, and 14.3 mg/g of BPA was adsorbed on SWNTs, while a total of 8.0, 6.4, and 5.1 mg/g was adsorbed on t-SWNTs with a 72-h contact time at 280, 295, and 315 K, respectively. A significantly high fraction of E2 (27.2 mg/g) was absorbed by both SWNTs and t-SWNTs, as compared to BPA. The adsorption kinetics was analyzed using a pseudo-second-order model. Sorption experiments showed that t-SWNTs adsorbed less than half as much BPA as SWNTs, but their E2 adsorption was similar. The sorption mechanism was investigated by performing molecular-level calculations. Adsorption energies calculated using density functional theory show preferential sorption of E2 to SWNTs and graphene (-26.2 kcal/mol on SWNT and -34.1 kcal/mol on graphene) compared to BPA (-17.1 kcal/mol on SWNT and -22.5 kcal/mol on graphene), which were consistent with the experimental findings. Thus, ab initio calculations can mechanistically explain the adsorption differences of BPA and E2 on SWNTs. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes can serve as simple nonpolar water channels. Here we report computer simulations exploring the relationship between the mechanical properties of such channels and their interaction with water. We show that on one hand, increasing the flexibility of the carbon nanotubes increases their apparent hydrophobic character, while on the other hand the presence of water inside the channel makes them more resistant to radial collapse. We quantify the effect of increasing flexibility on the hydrophobicity of the nanotube water channel. We also show that flexibility impedes water transport across the nanotube channel by increasing the free-energy barriers to such motion. Conversely, the presence of water inside the nanotube is shown to affect the energetics of radial collapse in a water nanotube, an ostensibly mechanical property. We quantify the magnitude of the effect and show that it arises from the formation of energetically favorable low-dimensional water structures inside the nanotube such as one-dimensional wires and two-dimensional sheets.},

abstract = {The coupling between noble metal nanostructures and chiral molecules gives rise to strong chiroptical responses in the range from the ultraviolet (UV) to visible spectrum. In this work, cysteine-modified Au/Ag alloyed nanotubes (ANTs) have been prepared by coupling cysteine with Au/Ag ANTs. The chiroptical responses strongly depend on the chirality of cysteine and show clear mirrored behaviours. In contrast to Ag- or Au-cysteine chiral hybrid nanorods, the cysteine-modified Au/Ag ANTs exhibit higher chiroptical responses due to a stronger local electromagnetic field. The induced CD signals emerge in the interband absorption region of Au/Ag ANTs rather than in the local surface plasmon bands, which can be attributed to both the extended helical network conformation on the surface of Au/Ag ANTs and the near-field enhancement effect of plasmonic nanotubes. This confirms that Coulomb interaction induces coupling between cysteine and Au/Ag ANTs, which allows cysteine molecules to form an extended helical network on the surface of Au/Ag ANTs. Furthermore, the cysteine-modified Au/Ag ANTs also show excellent chiral recognition for amino acids in catalytic electrochemical reactions due to the presence of chiral active sites and the steric effect of large groups.},

abstract = {Equating (3,−1) critical points (CPs), derived from the topological analysis of the electron densities, to chemical bonds has triggered a lot of confusion in recent years. Part of this confusion stems from calling these CPs “bond” CPs (BCPs). While the origin of this terminology is traceable to the late seventies and beginning of eighties, when it sounded reasonable, new computational studies conducted on molecular electron densities cast serious doubt on the supposed universal equivalence between the chemical bonds and (3,−1) CPs. Herein, recent computational studies are briefly reviewed to demonstrate why (3,−1) CPs are not indicators of chemical bonds. It is discussed why this confusing terminology needs to be changed and reemphasized that (3,−1) CPs should be called “line” critical points (LCPs). The proposed terminology detaches the topological properties of molecular electron densities from any a priori chemical interpretation. Such detachment, if adopted by other authors, will hopefully prevent further misinterpretation of the data emerging from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM).},

abstract = {Due to strong electric fields at the surface, the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by noble metal nanoparticles are strongly enhanced. These unique properties provide the potential of designing novel optically active reagents for simultaneous molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. It is desirable to use agents that are active in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the radiation spectrum to minimize the light extinction by intrinsic chromophores in native tissue. Gold nanorods with suitable aspect ratios (length divided by width) can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region (650-900 nm). In the present work, we provide an in vitro demonstration of gold nanorods as novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies and incubated in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCat) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). The anti-EGFR antibody-conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malignant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

With increasing dopant exposure, the mat resistance has been found to first decrease and then increase, exhibiting a minimum for optimal Cs doping. In contrast, for K doping, the mat resistance decreased monotonically and saturated. This unexpected result suggests that the diameter of the alkali-metal ion plays a role in the transport properties of the tube bundles. A doping-induced decrease in R by factors of ;120 and ;40 were observed for Cs- and K-doped SWNT mats, respectively. The low-temperature upturn of R(T) observed in all pristine SWNT samples was progressively suppressed with increased K doping. The optimally Cs-doped sample exhibited a positive dR/dT over the entire range of measurement $\sim$80 K,T,300 K!.

To date, graphene-based materials (GBMs) have piqued interest among researchers in the detection and remediation of BPA attributed to their salient properties of having large surface area, high conductivity, high functionalities, etc. Recent progress in GBMs has provided researchers with a wide array of synthesis techniques for various applications. Unfortunately, literature pertaining GBMs lagged in providing up-to-date research in BPA detection and remediation. Often, published review articles focused on the wide array of pollutants detection and remediation without a specific focus on a single pollutant. Hence, this review intends to reduce the knowledge gap by focusing on the recent studies pertaining usage of GBMs applications as electrochemical-based sensors and remediators via adsorption and photocatalysis of BPA. In sensing applications, GBMs sensors have evolved to be among the preferred choice for the detection of BPA. Provided that ample comprehensive reviews on the usage of GBMs as adsorbents and photocatalyst for various pollutants have been previously published, we focused our discussion solely on BPA as the model pollutant by providing up-to-date information on their synthesis route and performance ability. Certainly, this review will be useful to new entrants and experienced researchers intending to employ GBMs as the material of interest for the detection and remediation of BPA.},

The effects of water mole fraction were examined on the structural and dynamical properties of water/IL mixture and confined water/IL mixture. The total energy, the interaction energy between molecules and the radial distribution functions (RDFs) were calculated and compared at different water mole fractions for both water/IL mixture and confined water/IL mixture. The obtained results show that for the confined water/IL mixtures, the most interaction energy value is observed in pure water and pure IL systems. The analysis of the RDFs between different atoms of IL, water and SWCNT shows that the presence of SWCNT leads to a stronger spatial correlation between the water and IL molecules. Also, investigating the dihedral angle between the surface of SWCNT and the cation ring plane shows that the cations tend to orient their rings mainly parallel to the SWCNT surface. Finally, we calculated and compared the dynamics of the water molecules, anions, and cations at different water mole fractions in water/IL mixture and confined water/IL mixture. Two different regimes were observed for the confined and the bulk mixtures in low and high water mole fractions.},

It then discusses the expansive applications of CNT-based sensors to multiple areas including environmental monitoring, food and agriculture applications, biological sensors, and national security. The discussion of each analyte focuses on the strategies used to impart selectivity and the molecular interactions between the selector and the analyte. Finally, the review concludes with a brief outlook over future developments in the field of chemical sensors and their prospects for commercialization.},

abstract = {We present an efficient first-principles approach for calculating Fermi surface averages and spectral properties of solids, and use it to compute the low-field Hall coefficient of several cubic metals and the magnetic circular dichroism of iron. The first step is to perform a conventional first-principles calculation and store the low-lying Bloch functions evaluated on a uniform grid of k-points in the Brillouin zone. We then map those states onto a set of maximally-localized Wannier functions, and evaluate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and the other needed operators between the Wannier orbitals, thus setting up an ``exact tight-binding model.'' In this compact representation the k-space quantities are evaluated inexpensively using a generalized Slater-Koster interpolation. Because of the strong localization of the Wannier orbitals in real space, the smoothness and accuracy of the k-space interpolation increases rapidly with the number of grid points originally used to construct the Wannier functions. This allows k-space integrals to be performed with ab-initio accuracy at low cost. In the Wannier representation, band gradients, effective masses, and other k-derivatives needed for transport and optical coefficients can be evaluated analytically, producing numerically stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings.},

Our test systems comprise atomic and molecular adsorption of oxygen, CO, and NO on Ni(100), Ni(111), Rh(100), Pd(100), and Pd(111) surfaces. As the revPBE functional may locally violate the Lieb-Oxford criterion, we further develop an alternative revision of the PBE functional, RPBE, which gives the same improvement of the chemisorption energies as the revPBE functional at the same time as it fulfills the Lieb-Oxford criterion locally.

@article{Hennrich2005,
abstract = {Resonance Raman spectroscopy/microscopy was used to study individualized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) both in aqueous suspensions as well as after spin-coating onto Si/SiO2 surfaces. Four different SWNT materials containing nanotubes with diameters ranging from 0.7 to 1.6 nm were used. Comparison with Raman data obtained for suspensions shows that the surface does not dramatically affect the electronic properties of the deposited tubes. Raman features observed for deposited SWNTs are similar to what was measured for nanotubes directly fabricated on surfaces using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods. In particular, individual semiconducting tubes could be distinguished from metallic tubes by their different G-mode line shapes. It could also be shown that the high-power, short-time sonication used to generate individualized SWNT suspensions does not induce defects in great quantities. However, (additional) defects can be generated by laser irradiation of deposited SWNTs in air, thus giving rise to an increase of the D-mode intensity for even quite low power densities (approximately 10(4) W/cm2).},

abstract = {The interaction between two Cl− ions separated by the wall of a narrow carbon nanotube has been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and by DFT-based tight binding (DFTB+). The direct Coulomb interaction between the ions is screened by the nanotube, no matter if the latter is conducting or semiconducting. The presence of the ions induces changes in the electronic density of states of the nanotube, which results in an effective attraction between the ions of the order of 0.2–0.3 eV. The interaction of the outside ions with the tube has a covalent component, when the two ions are near there is even a direct chemical attraction between the ions. In contrast to the effective attraction between two Li+ ions reported before (Juarez et al., Phys Chem Chem Phys 22:10,603, 2020), the effect cannot be explained in terms of physical concepts alone. DFTB+ performs well when compared with DFT, and lends itself to fast calculations for large systems.},

The implementation is done using explicit propagation in the time domain and a self-consistent program that uses a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). Our actual calculations employ the SIESTA program, which is designed to be fast and accurate for large clusters. We use the adiabatic local density approximation to account for exchange and correlation effects. Results are presented for the imaginary part of the linear polarizability, Im [\alpha(w)], and the dipole strength function, S(w), of C60 and Na8, compared to previous calculations and to experiment. We also show how to calculate the integrated frequency-dependent second order non-linear polarizability for the case of a step function electric field, \gamma_{step}(w), and present results for C60.},

abstract = {The DDEC6 method is one of the most accurate and broadly applicable atomic population analysis methods. It works for a broad range of periodic and non-periodic materials with no magnetism, collinear magnetism, and non-collinear magnetism irrespective of the basis set type. First, we show DDEC6 charge partitioning to assign net atomic charges corresponds to solving a series of 14 Lagrangians in order. Then, we provide flow diagrams for overall DDEC6 analysis, spin partitioning, and bond order calculations. We wrote an OpenMP parallelized Fortran code to provide efficient computations. We show that by storing large arrays as shared variables in cache line friendly order, memory requirements are independent of the number of parallel computing cores and false sharing is minimized. We show that both total memory required and the computational time scale linearly with increasing numbers of atoms in the unit cell. Using the presently chosen uniform grids, computational times of ∼9 to 94 seconds per atom were required to perform DDEC6 analysis on a single computing core in an Intel Xeon E5 multi-processor unit. Parallelization efficiencies were usually >50% for computations performed on 2 to 16 cores of a cache coherent node. As examples we study a B-DNA decamer, nickel metal, supercells of hexagonal ice crystals, six X@C60 endohedral fullerene complexes, a water dimer, a Mn12-acetate single molecule magnet exhibiting collinear magnetism, a Fe4O12N4C40H52 single molecule magnet exhibiting non-collinear magnetism, and several spin states of an ozone molecule. Efficient parallel computation was achieved for systems containing as few as one and as many as >8000 atoms in a unit cell. We varied many calculation factors (e.g., grid spacing, code design, thread arrangement, etc.) and report their effects on calculation speed and precision. We make recommendations for excellent performance.},

Our values for these characteristic temperatures are: 410'K for Ni, 420'K for Fe, 400'K for Al, 325'K for Cu, and 190'K for Au. The magnetic Curie temperature for Ni is found to be 352'C. In plotting true coefficient of thermal expansion versus temperature Simon and Bergmann found a horizontal plateau at about 175' to 235'K for Ni and Fe; but we do not confirm this.},

abstract = {Protagonists in the emerging field of nanotechnology have as their objective the design, construction and study of useful devices based on nanoscale materials and objects. Objects or structures that have at least one important dimension in the range 0.5 to perhaps 50 nm may be considered to be in the nanoscale domain. These sizes lie far below the 200 nm or so that can be resolved with an optical microscope, and are closer in size to the 0.3 nm diameter of individual atoms. The field of nanotechnology is attracting keen interest at present. The excitement is motivated by the observation that control of matter at the nanoscale holds the promise of, amongst others, faster computing, better medicines, and more useful materials. In this paper, the physical phenomena on which this optimism is based are broadly discussed and explained. Where appropriate, examples of the rather different and curious properties of gold at the nanoscale are used to illustrate the points covered.},

abstract = {In situ Raman spectroscopy allows for a detailed and time-resolved investigation of the kinetics of complex physical or chemical processes. Oxidation has become a frequently used method for the removal of disordered carbon species from carbon nanotubes. Oxidation, however, can also induce damage to the tubes and destroy most of the sample. We conducted an in situ Raman spectroscopy study of the oxidation of double- and single-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNT and SWCNT) under isothermal and nonisothermal conditions to identify the temperature range in which the oxidation of amorphous carbon occurs without any changes with respect to the tubes and their structure. In situ Raman spectroscopy analysis of the oxidation of DWCNTs showed a decrease in the intensity of the D band starting around 370°C, followed by complete D band elimination at 440°C. Oxidation studies of SWCNTs showed a similar decrease in the D band intensity, but the D band was not completely eliminated. Furthermore, in situ measurements allow us to determine the different contributions to the D band feature and show the relationship between the D band, G band, and RBM Raman modes in the Raman spectra of DWCNT upon heating. Isothermal oxidation provides an efficient purification method for DWCNTs and SWCNTs, which is also selective to tube diameter. After oxidation, tubes show clean surfaces without disordered or amorphous carbon impurities. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

For many applications, it became crucial to use the smallest ones and at the same time to be able to detect them at the single particle level with versatile optical methods. Such methods should also allow the study of their intimate optical properties. Here we review the ultra-sensitive optical methods based on the photothermal effect which permit the detection of individual gold nanoparticies down to 1.4 nm through their absorption. The absorption spectroscopy of the Surface Plasmon Resonance of individual gold nanoparticles down to 5nm is further presented and revealed intrinsic size effects in the optical response of the smallest nanoparticles. Different applications to biology are also presented such as for new types of gold nanoparticles based DNA microarrays and for live cell molecular imaging owing to the insensitivity of the photothermal methods to scattering environments.},

abstract = {This work presents the fabrication of gold nanotube membranes (GNT) using gold deposition on porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template and demonstrates the catalytic properties generated by the nanostructured gold surface. AAO membranes were prepared by electrochemical anodization of Al in 0.3 M oxalic acid electrolyte. Electroless gold deposition on AAO was performed via several steps using commercially available gold plating solutions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirm that the gold nanotubes formed inside AAO pores have characteristic nanoclustered morphology as a result of the nucleation process during gold deposition. It was found that catalytic properties of GNT membranes depend on the size of gold nanoclusters which can be controlled by pH during nucleation process. The excellent catalytic properties (catalytic rate constant k = 0.132 min -1) of the GNT membranes were demonstrated by testing catalytic conversion of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of NaBH 4 as a reductant. The correlation between the size of gold nanoclusters and catalytic activity was verified showing the capability of controlling and further improving catalytic properties of GNT membranes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Large quantities of pentagonal gold nanotubes have been synthesized by reducing chloroauric acid with silver nanowires in an aqueous solution of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at room temperature. These gold nanotubes possess perfect structures, smooth surfaces, highly crystalline walls, and similar cross-sections to that of the silver template. In this process, the CTAB participation was found to be crucial for shape-controlled synthesis of pentagonal gold nanotubes. In the absence of CTAB, loose and hollow gold structures were routinely generated, while bundled gold nanotubes with rough surfaces were obtained by replacing the CTAB with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). The possible formation mechanism of pentagonal gold nanotubes has also been discussed on the basis of various growth stages studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images. In addition, the catalytic properties of these hollow nanostructures for hydrogen generation reaction from HCHO solution have also been investigated. They showed higher activity than that of spherical gold nanoparticles. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The structure and dynamics of water confined in single-walled silicon carbon nanotubes (SWSiCNTs)are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The density of water inside SWSiCNTs isreported, and an equation is suggested to predict the density of water inside SWSiCNTs. Interestingly, thewater diffusion coefficients (D) here are larger compared with those in SWCNTs and single-walled boron-nitride nanotubes (SWBNNTs). Furthermore, water inside zigzag SWCNTs has a lower diffusion coefficientthan water inside armchair SWCNTs. A thorough analysis of the density profiles, hydrogen bonding, andwater molecule orientation inside SWSiCNTs is presented to explore the mechanism behind the diffusivebehavior of water observed here. It is shown here, by mean square displacement (MSD) analysis, thatwater molecules inside SWSiCNTs diffuse with a ballistic motion mechanism for up to 500 ps. Additionallyit is confirmed here for the first time that water molecules confined in the SWSiCNTs with diameters ofless than 10˚A obey the single-file diffusion mechanism at time scales in excess of 500 ps. The orientationof water molecules inside SWSiCNTs could be a good explanation for the difference between the diffusioncoefficient in (6,6) and (10,0) SWSiCNTs. Finally, a PMF analysis explains the difficulty of water entranceinto SWSiCNTs and also the different water self-diffusion inside armchair and zigzag SWSiCNTs. Theseresults are motivating reasons to use SWSiCNTs in nanoscale biochannels, for instance, in drug-deliveryapplications.},

The spatial distributions of channeled protons are generated using a computer simulation method, which includes the numerical solving of the proton equations of motion in the transverse plane. We show that the dynamic polarization effect can strongly affect the rainbow maxima in the spatial distributions, so as to increase the proton flux at distances from the nanotube wall of the order of a few tenths of a nanometer at the expense of the flux at the nanotube center. While our findings are connected to the possible applications of nanosized ion beams created with the nanotubes embedded in various dielectric media for biomedical research and in materials modification, they also open prospects of applying ion channeling for detecting and locating atoms and molecules intercalated inside the nanotubes.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces resisting water penetration into their texture under dynamic impact conditions and offering simultaneously additional functionalities can find use in a multitude of applications. We present a facile, environmentally benign, and economical fabrication of highly electrically conductive, polymer-based superhydrophobic coatings, with impressive ability to resist dynamic water impalement through droplet impact. To impart electrical conductivity, the coatings were prepared by drop casting suspensions with loadings of different kinds of carbon nanoparticles, namely, carbon black (CB), carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and their combinations, in a fluoropolymer dispersion. At 50 wt % either CB or CNT, the nanocomposite coatings resisted impalement by water drops impacting at 3.7 m/s, the highest attainable speed in our setup. However, when tested with 5 vol % isopropyl alcohol-water mixture, i.e., a lower surface tension liquid posing a stiffer challenge with respect to impalement, only the CB coatings retained their impalement resistance behavior. GNP-based surfaces featured very high conductivity ∼1000 S/m, but the lowest resistance to water impalement. The optimal performance was obtained by combining the carbon fillers. Coatings containing CB:GNP:polymer = 1:1:2 showed both excellent impalement resistance (up to 3.5 m/s with 5 vol % IPA-water mixture drops) and electrical conductivity (∼1000 S/m). All coatings exhibited superhydrophobic and oleophilic behavior. To exemplify the additional benefit coming from this property, the CB and the optimal, combined CB/GNP coatings were used to separate mineral oil and water through filtration of their mixture.},

@article{Hubbard1964,
abstract = {In a previous paper a theory of correlation effects in narrow s -bands was described. In this paper a generalization of that theory applicable to narrow degenerate electron bands is developed. The theory is based upon the notion that in the case of narrow bands the most important correlations are those between electrons on the same atom. The solution obtained has the important property of going over into the ordinary band theory solution in the appropriate limit (no interaction) and the exact atomic (Heitler-London) solution in the opposite limit (zero band-width). In order to elucidate the general properties of the solution some simplified models are discussed, and the more elementary implications of the theory when applied to the d -bands of transition metals are indicated. A physical interpretation of the results of the theory is given; the physical picture which emerges is found to be closely related to a theory discussed earlier by Van Vleck.},

@article{Goldberger2003,
abstract = {Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 (ref. 1), there have been significant research efforts to synthesize nanometrescale tubular forms of various solids. The formation of tubular nanostructure generally requires a layered or anisotropic crystal structure. There are reports of nanotubes made from silica, alumina, silicon and metals that do not have a layered crystal structure; they are synthesized by using carbon nanotubes and porous membranes as templates, or by thin-film rolling. These nanotubes, however, are either amorphous, polycrystalline or exist only in ultrahigh vacuum. The growth of single-crystal semiconductor hollow nanotubes would be advantageous in potential nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics and biochemical-sensing applications. Here we report an 'epitaxial casting' approach for the synthesis of single-crystal GaN nanotubes with inner diameters of 30-200 nm and wall thicknesses of 5-50 nm. Hexagonal ZnO nanowires were used as templates for the epitaxial overgrowth of thin GaN layers in a chemical vapour deposition system. The ZnO nanowire templates were subsequently removed by thermal reduction and evaporation, resulting in ordered arrays of GaN nanotubes on the substrates. This templating process should be applicable to many other semiconductor systems.},

abstract = {By using molecular dynamics simulation, we have investigated systematically the feasibility of continuous unidirectional water flux across a deformed single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) driven by an oscillating charge outside without osmotic pressure or hydrostatic drop. Simulation results indicate that the flux is dependent sensitively on the oscillating frequency of the charge, the distance of the charge from the SWNT, and the asymmetry of the water-SWNT system. A resonance-like phenomenon is found that the water flux is enhanced significantly when the period of the oscillation is close to twice the average hopping time of water molecules inside the SWNT. These findings are helpful in developing a novel design of efficient functional nanofluidic devices.},

However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.},

Here, the controlled synthesis is developed for preparing high-aspect ratio gold nanotubes (AuNTs) with tailorable wall thickness, microstructure, composition, and optical characteristics. The modulation of optical properties generates AuNTs with strong near infrared absorption. Surface modification enhances dispersibility of AuNTs in aqueous media and results in low cytotoxicity. The uptake and trafficking of these AuNTs by primary mesothelioma cells demonstrate their accumulation in a perinuclear distribution where they are confined initially in membrane-bound vesicles from which they ultimately escape to the cytosol. This represents the first study of the cellular interactions of high-aspect ratio 1D metal nanomaterials and will facilitate the rational design of plasmonic nanoconstructs as cytosolic nanoagents for potential diagnosis and therapeutic applications.},

The problem of complicated wiring of traditional wired monitoring system is solved. Through Bluetooth module, the communication between STM32 single chip microcomputer and host computer can realize the real-time detection of environmental temperature and humidity. When there is danger in the room, the mobile phone or work computer can receive warning signals in time. The experimental results show that the system has the advantages of good real-time, high data transmission reliability and good intelligence, Meanwhile, the cable is saved and the cost is reduced.},

Here we report the synthesis of a previously unobserved composite material of elemental sulphur, consisting of monatomic chains stabilized in the constraining volume of a carbon nanotube. This one-dimensional phase is confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, these one-dimensional sulphur chains exhibit long domain sizes of up to 160 nm and high thermal stability ($\sim$800 K). Synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows a sharp structural transition of the one-dimensional sulphur occurring at $\sim$450-650 K. Our observations, and corresponding electronic structure and quantum transport calculations, indicate the conducting character of the one-dimensional sulphur chains under ambient pressure. This is in stark contrast to bulk sulphur that needs ultrahigh pressures exceeding $\sim$90 GPa to become metallic.},

abstract = {We report a new method for the synthesis of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanotubes. When anatase-phase- or rutile-phase-containing TiO2 was treated with an aqueous solution of 5-10 M NaOH for 20 h at 110 °C and then with HCl aqueous solution and distilled water, needle-shaped TiO2 products were obtained (diameter ≈8 nm, length ≈100 nm). The needle-shaped products are nanotubes with inner diameters of approximately 5 nm and outer diameters of approximately 8 nm. The formation mechanism of titania nanotubes is discussed in terms of the detailed observation of the products by transmission electron microscopy: the crystalline raw material is first converted to an amorphous product through alkali treatment, and subsequently, titania nanotubes are formed after treatment with distilled water and HCl aqueous solution.},

abstract = {First-principles calculations have been performed to study the effects of adsorbates (CO molecules and O atoms) and defects on electronic structures and transport properties of Au nanotubes (Au(5, 3) and Au(5, 5)). For CO adsorption, various adsorption sites of CO on the Au tubes were considered. The vibrational frequency of the CO molecule was found to be very different for two nearly degenerate stable adsorption configurations of Au(5, 3), implying the possibility of distinguishing these two configurations via measuring the vibrational frequency of CO in experiments. After CO adsorption, the conductance of Au(5, 3) decreases by 0.9G0 and the conductance of Au(5, 5) decreases by approximately 0.5G0. For O-adsorbed Au tubes, O atoms strongly interact with Au tubes, leading to around 2G0 of drop in conductance for both Au tubes. These results may have implications for Au-tube-based chemical sensing. When a monovacancy defect is present, we found that, for both tubes, the conductance decreases by around 1G0. Another type of defect arising from the adhesion of one Au atom is also considered. For this case, it is found that, for the Au(5, 3) tube, the defect decreases the conductance by nearly 1G0, whereas for Au(5, 5), the decrease in conductance is only 0.3G0. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The consistency between the exchange-correlation functional used in pseudopotential construction and in the actual density functional theory calculation is essential for the accurate prediction of fundamental properties of materials. However, routine hybrid density functional calculations at present still rely on generalized gradient approximation pseudopotentials due to the lack of hybrid functional pseudopotentials. Here, we present a scheme for generating hybrid functional pseudopotentials, and we analyze the importance of pseudopotential density functional consistency for hybrid functionals. For the PBE0 hybrid functional, we benchmark our pseudopotentials for structural parameters and fundamental electronic gaps of the Gaussian-2 (G2) molecular dataset and some simple solids. Our results show that using our PBE0 pseudopotentials in PBE0 calculations improves agreement with respect to all-electron calculations.},

We placed CNTs on copper TEM grids for structural analysis and on AFM probes for the assembly of AFM super-tips. We used electrothermally actuated polysilicon microgrippers designed using topology optimization in the experiments. The microgrippers are able to open as well as close. Topology optimization leads to a 10-100 times improvement of the gripping force compared to conventional designs of similar size. Furthermore, we improved our nanorobotic system to offer more degrees of freedom. TEM investigation of the CNTs shows that the multi-walled tubes are coated with an amorphous carbon layer, which is locally removed at the contact points with the microgripper. The assembled AFM super-tips are used for AFM measurements of microstructures with high aspect ratios.},

abstract = {THE synthesis of molecular carbon structures in the form of C60 and other fullerenes 1 has stimulated intense interest in the structures accessible to graphitic carbon sheets. Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.},

In situ observations of sputtering at 1{\textperiodcentered}0 MeV are described in which evaporated (111) gold foils developed a heavily pitted surface. The pit density varied with specimen temperature and sputtering rate but was reduced near pre-existing surface steps. Forbidden reflection electron microscopy (Chems 1974) showed also that pitting developed on areas of an originally perfect (111) surface. A theoretical model is proposed in which pits form by the surface diffusion and agglomeration of surface vacancies produced by sputtering and it is shown that this model explains the experimental results in some detail. A value of Em=0{\textperiodcentered}45 + 0{\textperiodcentered}15 eV is derived for the migration energy of a surface vacancy on (111) gold. It is suggested that the surface diffusion model explains observations of surface roughening in other systems. {\textcopyright} 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

Under the temperature conditions in the current photoelectron spectroscopy experiment, O2-bound gold clusters were observed only for n = 22-24 and 34. Nevertheless, O2 binding with the clusters in the size range of n = 20-34 can be still predicted based on the obtained global-minimum structures. Consequently, a series of structural transitions, from the pyramidal to fused-planar to core-shell structures, are either identified or predicted for the AunO2- clusters, where the O2-binding is in either superoxo or peroxo fashion. The identified global-minimum structures of AunO2- (n = 20-34) also allow us to gain improved understanding of why the clusters Aun- (n = 26-32) are less reactive with O2 in comparison to others.},

abstract = {The adsorption mechanism of glucose molecule on intrinsic and Pt-decorated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was studied using first-principles van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) calculations. The adsorption of glucose simultaneously was investigated on both (8, 0) and (5, 5) SWCNTs for a comparison. The results indicated that (8, 0) SWCNT is a better media for adsorbing glucose molecule in comparison with (5, 5) SWCNT. It is also found that the glucose molecule is strongly adsorbed at the most stable state of Pt-decorated (8, 0) SWCNT whit binding energy of about-74.37 kcal/mol. Our calculations show that Pt-decorated nanotubes have much higher binding energy, higher net charge transfer values and shorter connecting distances than intrinsic nanotube due to chemisorption of the glucose molecule. Furthermore, the density of states shows that orbital hybridization is visible between the glucose and Pt-decorated nanotube, while there is no evidence for hybridization between the glucose molecule and the intrinsic nanotube. Therefore, Pt-decorated carbon nanotube is expected to be a novel material for enhancing the fabrication of glucose biosensors.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

We substitute the customary diagonalization procedure by the minimization of a modified energy functional, which gives orthogonal wave functions and the same energy and density as the Kohn–Sham energy functional, without the need of an explicit orthogonalization. The additional restriction to a finite range for the electron wave functions allows the computational effort (time and memory) to increase only linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations. We present test calculations beginning with small molecules and ending with a piece of DNA. Using double-z, polarized bases, geometries within 1% of experiments are obtained. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 65: 453–461, 1997},

The ARD-catalyzed reaction represents a branch point in the MSP. The on-pathway reaction (Scheme 1) results in the forma-tion of formate and the keto-acid precursor of methio-nine, 4-thiomethyl-2-ketobutyrate. An off-pathway reaction (Scheme 2) results in the production of for-mate, carbon monoxide and 3-thiomethylpropionate. It has been shown that the identity of the metal bound in the ARD active site controls which of these two reac-tions occur. In the case of the enzyme isolated from Klebsiella oxytoca, KoARD, the first ARD to be char-acterized, the on-pathway enzyme (KoARD') binds Fe +2 and that catalyzing the off-pathway reaction (KoARD) binds Ni +2 .

abstract = {It is believed that strong ferromagnetic interactions in some solids are generated by subtle interplay between quantum many-body effects and spin-independent Coulomb interactions between electrons. It is a challenging problem to verify this scenario in the Hubbard model, which is an idealized model for strongly interacting electrons in a solid. Nagaoka's ferromagnetism is a well-known rigorous example of ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model. It deals with the limiting situation in which there is one fewer electron than in the half-filling and the on-site Coulomb interaction is infinitely large. There are relatively new rigorous examples of ferromagnetism in Hubbard models called flat-band ferromagnetism. Flat-band ferromagnetism takes place in carefully prepared models in which the lowest bands (in the single-electron spectra) are "flat." Usually, these two approaches are regarded as two complimentary routes to ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model. In the present paper we describe Nagaoka's ferromagnetism and flat-band ferromagnetism in detail, giving all the necessary background as well as complete (but elementary) mathematical proofs. By studying an intermediate model called the long-range hopping model, we also demonstrate that there is indeed a deep relation between these two seemingly different approaches to ferromagnetism. We further discuss some attempts to go beyond these approaches. We briefly discuss recent rigorous example of ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model which has neither infinitely large parameters nor completely flat bands. We give preliminary discussion regarding possible experimental realizations of the (nearly-)flat-band ferromagnetism. Finally, we focus on some theoretical attempts to understand metallic ferromagnetism. We discuss three artificial one-dimensional models in which the existence of metallic ferromagnetism can be easily proved. We have tried to make the present paper as self-contained as possible, keeping in mind readers who are new to the field. Although the present paper is written as a review, it contains some material which appears for the first time.},

abstract = {Due to development of electronic devices, thermal management and electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems in electronic devices are becoming crucial issues. In the present work, a novel method is proposed for the synthesis of thermally- and electrically-conductive graphene-copper/polymer composites. The graphene surface is grafted with the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA), and the graphene-copper double 3D network structure is fabricated via a freeze drying method. The double structure is then pressed and wetted with epoxy to create a polymer-based composite. The as-prepared interconnected conductive network structure forms a continuous thermally and electrically conductive pathway, while the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties are further enhanced by the decreased interfacial resistance between the filler and matrix. In detail, the composite is shown to exhibit a high EMI shielding efficiency of 38.16 dB and a thermal conductivity of 1.20 W/mK. In addition, the composite exhibits a tensile modulus of 48.86 MPa, and an elongation at breaking point of 10.72%. The present authors believe that this approach holds great promise for the development of EMI shielding and thermally conductive materials.},

These types of defects are often found in real nanotubes and affect their properties. We have established that reliable results can be obtained by using models of more than 1.5 nm in length. It turned out that a single vacancy defect has the least influence on Young modulus, and double n type vacancy defect in the most influential. The elongation at break also depends on the defect type and is 30-60% less than for perfect tubes.},

abstract = {In this work we present ab initio calculations of the formation energies and stability of different types of multi-vacancies in carbon nanotubes. We demonstrate that, as in the case of graphene, the reconstruction of the defects has drastic effects on the energetics of the tubes. In particular, the formation of pentagons eliminates the dangling bonds thus lowering the formation energy. This competition leads to vacancies having an even number of carbon atoms removed to be more stable. Finally the appearance of magic numbers indicating more stable defects can be represented by a model for the formation energies that is based on the number of dangling bonds of the unreconstructed system, the pentagons and the relaxation of the final form of the defect formed after the relaxation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Many complexes containing these non-covalent bonds were identified and characterised in isolation in the gas phase by rotational and vibrational spectroscopy long before they were given these names. In this article, the geometries so determined for selected examples of complexes of each type are rationalised in terms of the molecular electrostatic surface potentials of the component molecules. Examples of chalcogen-bonded complexes considered are based mainly on sulfur dioxide, with the region near the sulfur atom as the electrophilic site that interacts with n-electron and $\pi$-electron pairs for a range of simple Lewis base molecules. For tetrel bonds, the examples discussed involve the carbon atom of carbon dioxide as the electrophilic centre, while for pnictogen bonds the central nitrogen of the closely related molecule nitrous oxide is chosen. Geometrical similarities within each series allow simple definitions of each type of non-covalent bond that are conformal with that recently advanced for the halogen bond, a related non-covalent interaction.},

abstract = {Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were oxidized in air and acids while varying the treatment time and/or temperature. The goal of this approach was to create the highest density of carboxyl groups with moderate sample loss, which is necessary for nanocomposite applications. In situ Raman experiments allowed real-time observation of the structural changes in MWCNTs upon oxidation. The ratio of the Raman intensities of theDandGbands was used to estimate the concentration of defects. It was found that while an oxidation for 6 h in H2SO4/HNO3 provided the strongest effect, a ‘flash oxidation' in air (15 min at 550 °C) also leads to an efficient functionalization in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way. Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and electrophoretic mobility analysis were used to study the oxidized nanotubes.

abstract = {The ability to tune the properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) through modification of the nanoribbon's width and edge structure widens the potential applications of graphene in electronic devices. Although assembly of GNRs has been recently possible, current methods suffer from limited control of their atomic structure, or require the careful organization of precursors on atomically flat surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Here we demonstrate that a GNR can self-assemble from a random mixture of molecular precursors within a single-walled carbon nanotube, which ensures propagation of the nanoribbon in one dimension and determines its width. The sulphur-terminated dangling bonds of the GNR make these otherwise unstable nanoribbons thermodynamically viable over other forms of carbon. Electron microscopy reveals elliptical distortion of the nanotube, as well as helical twist and screw-like motion of the nanoribbon. These effects suggest novel ways of controlling the properties of these nanomaterials, such as the electronic band gap and the concentration of charge carriers.},

The obtained optimized geometries reveal that Li atoms insertion dramatically modifies the nanotube structures. Averaged binding energies, fragmentation energies, second-order energy differences, and Mulliken population analysis are expressed as Li concentration functions. Results reveal Fermi level displacement towards the conduction band due to the Li atoms' charge transfer to the nanotube walls. Stability analysis identifies the complexes with superior relative stability. In particular, nanotubes (7.7) and (8.8) show storage capacities that exceed the graphite's intercalation limit.},

abstract = {Developing a comprehensive method to compute bond orders is a problem that has eluded chemists since Lewis's pioneering work on chemical bonding a century ago. Here, a computationally efficient method solving this problem is introduced and demonstrated for diverse materials including elements from each chemical group and period. The method is applied to non-magnetic, collinear magnetic, and non-collinear magnetic materials with localized or delocalized bonding electrons. Examples studied include the stretched O2 molecule, 26 diatomic molecules, 3d and 5d transition metal solids, periodic materials with 1 to 8748 atoms per unit cell, a biomolecule, a hypercoordinate molecule, an electron deficient molecule, hydrogen bound systems, transition states, Lewis acid-base complexes, aromatic compounds, magnetic systems, ionic materials, dispersion bound systems, nanostructures, and other materials. From near-zero to high-order bonds were studied. Both the bond orders and the sum of bond orders for each atom are accurate across various bonding types: metallic, covalent, polar-covalent, ionic, aromatic, dative, hypercoordinate, electron deficient multi-centered, agostic, and hydrogen bonding. The method yields similar results for correlated wavefunction and density functional theory inputs and for different SZ values of a spin multiplet. The method requires only the electron and spin magnetization density distributions as input and has a computational cost scaling linearly with increasing number of atoms in the unit cell. No prior approach is as general. The method does not apply to electrides, highly time-dependent states, some extremely high-energy excited states, and nuclear reactions.},

Starting from the band structure of (4,3) and (5,3) AuNTs, we find that the magnitude of the chiral currents are greater than those found in carbon nanotubes. We also calculate the associated magnetic flux inside the tubes and find this to be higher than the case of carbon nanotubes. Although (4,3) and (5,3) AuNTs carry transverse momenta of similar magnitudes, the low-bias magnetic flux carried by the former is far greater than that carried by the latter. This arises because the low-bias longitudinal current carried by a (4,3) AuNT is significantly smaller than that of a (5,3) AuNT.},

The applicability of the scaling laws to more complex structures of interconnected networks of bundles in carbon nanotube (CNT) films and mats is investigated in mesoscopic simulations. The heat transfer in CNT materials is found to be strongly enhanced by self-organization of CNTs into continuous networks of bundles. The thermal conductivity of CNT films varies by orders of magnitude depending on the length of the nanotubes and their structural arrangement in the material.},

abstract = {Flexible electrodes of ternary composites, in which highly conductive carbon nanotube films (CNFs) are coated with carbon nanotube-doped graphene oxide/polypyrrole (CNT-GO/PPy), have been fabricated via facile electrochemical synthesis. Long and short CNTs are separately doped into the composites (lCNT-GO/PPy and sCNT-GO/PPy) and their electrochemical performances are compared. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the doping of CNTs in the composites significantly improves the electrochemical behaviors of the GO/PPy electrodes. Notably, the lCNT-GO/PPy electrodes show superior electrochemical properties with respect to the sCNT-GO/PPy electrodes, which is related to the introduction of abundant CNTs in the former electrodes and their special microstructures. Two symmetric electrodes with the lCNT-GO/PPy composites coated on CNFs are assembled to fabricate a solid-state supercapacitor device, which features lightweight, ultrathinness, and high flexibility. The device achieves a high areal and volumetric specific capacitance of 70.0 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1 and 6.3 F cm−3 at 0.043 A cm−3, respectively. It also shows superior rate performance and cycle stability, with a capacitance retention rate of 87.7% for 10,000 cycles. The supercapacitor device fabricated is promising for the use in lightweight and flexible integrated electronics.},

The calculations of vibrational properties of double-walled hybrid nanostructures SWCNT inside SWBNNT (SWCNT@SWBNNT) are performed in the framework of the force constants model, using the spectral moment's method (SMM). To describe the Van der Waals interactions between inner and outer tubes in hybrid systems, we used a Lennard-Jones potential. These predictions are useful to interpret the experimental data.},

@article{Salvatierra2018,
abstract = {The growing demand for sustainable and off-grid energy storage is reviving the attempts to use Li metal as the anode in the next generation of batteries. However, the use of Li anodes is hampered due to the growth of Li dendrites upon charging and discharging, which compromises the life and safety of the battery. Here, it is shown that lithiated multiwall carbon nanotubes (Li-MWCNTs) act as a controlled Li diffusion interface that suppresses the growth of Li dendrites by regulating the Li+ ion flux during charge/discharge cycling at current densities between 2 and 4 mA cm−2. A full Li-S cell is fabricated to showcase the versatility of the protected Li anode with the Li-MWCNT interface, where the full cells could support pulse discharges at high currents and over 450 cycles at different rates with coulombic efficiencies close to 99.9%. This work indicates that carbon materials in lithiated forms can be an effective and simple approach to the stabilization of Li metal anodes.},

abstract = {The DFT study of atomic and electronic structure of the nanohybrid systems graphene-C60 as the possible structural elements of graphite-like amorphous carbon formed by pulsed laser evaporation was performed. Various models of the interaction of C60 fullerene fragments and whole fullerenes with single-layer graphene are considered. The mechanisms of adsorption, the local atomic structure, and the energy spectrum of the considered hybrid systems were studied in the framework of the Kohn-Sham method and the pseudopotential approximation. It is shown that depending on the orientation of the fullerene fragment, as well as on the distance of approach of this fragment relative to the sp2-carbon plane the fragment can interact with graphene via physisorption mechanism, form different metastable structures, or form closed fullerene-like structures due to the formation of chemical bonds that integrate into the graphene sheet. In this work, we estimated the interatomic distances at the interfaces and the adsorption energy of fullerene fragments on graphene. The calculations showed that the electronic spectrum of the graphene-fullerene system with dispersion interaction in the interface was characterized by the superposition of the electronic states of the graphene sheet and the fullerene fragment separately, as well as by n-doping of the spectrum of this fragment. At the same time, it was demonstrated that the electronic energy spectrum of the integrated structures significantly differed from the spectra of pure graphene as well as С60, and was characterized by sp2-and sp3-hybridized carbon. The comparison of the calculated graphene-½C60 spectra with graphene and graphene-C60 DOS as well as with experimental electron energy loss spectrum of the C60 and with the differential tunneling current-voltage characteristic of the system graphene/С60 /Cu was performed. Satisfactory fit was obtained for the calculated data and the experiment.},

abstract = {We study the electronic structure of (n,0) zigzag carbon nanotubes by means of two complementary numerical methods. Using the semiempirical PM3 method, we carry out quantum-chemical calculations for tube fragments of different symmetry and size, which represent these tubes. Using the tight-binding method, we proceed in parallel to determine the band structure of these tubes. The effect of cluster size on the structure of frontier orbitals and on the cluster stability is investigated for the (6,0) tube. We show that the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the (n,0) tube fragments are localized on the edge atoms. The comparison between the band structure of the (6,0) tube and the molecular orbitals of the (6,0) tube fragment with 13 carbon hexagons along the tube axis indicates that the spatial structure of the HOMO`s and the LUMO`s directly corresponds to that of the Bloch wave functions of occupied and unoccupied pi bands near the Fermi level.},

abstract = {Palladium nanowires prepared using the lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) method are used to detect hydrogen gas (H2). These palladium nanowires are prepared by electrodepositing palladium from EDTA-containing solutions under conditions favoring the formation of $\beta$-phase PdHx. The Pd nanowires produced by this procedure are characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These nanowires have a mean grain diameter of 15 nm and are composed of pure Pd with no XPS-detectable bulk carbon. The four-point resistance of 50-100 $\mu$m segments of individual nanowires is used to detect H2 in N2 and air at concentrations ranging from 2 ppm to 10%. For low [H2] < 1%, the response amplitude increases by a factor of 2-3 with a reduction in the lateral dimensions of the nanowire. Smaller nanowires show accelerated response and recovery rates at all H2 concentrations from, 5 ppm to 10%. For 12 devices, response and recovery times are correlated with the surface area/volume ratio of the palladium detection element. We conclude that the kinetics of hydrogen adsorption limits the observed response rate seen for the nanowire, and that hydrogen desorption from the nanowire limits the observed recovery rate; proton diffusion within PdHx does not limit the rates of either of these processes.},

A highly ordered silver and gold nanotubes arrays were embedded in 100 nm pores of PET TeMs via electroless deposition technique at 4°C during 1 h. All "as-prepared" composites were examined for catalytic activity using reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) by sodium borohydride as a common reaction to test metallic nanostructures catalysts. The effect of temperature on the catalytic activity was investigated in range of 292-313 K and activation energy were calculated. Kapp of Ag/PET composites linearly increase with an increase of the temperature thus normal Arrhenius behavior have been seen and the activation energy was calculated to be 42.13 kJ/mol. Au/PET composites exhibit not only more powerful catalytic activity but also non-linear dependence of rate constant from temperature. Kapp increased with increasing temperature throughout the 292-308 K temperature range; the reaction had an activation energy 65.32 kJ/mol. In range 311-313 K rate constant dramatically decreased and the apparent activation energy at this temperature rang was -91.44 kJ/mol due some structural changes, i.e. agglomeration of Au nanoparticles on the surface of composite.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. First-principles modeling is used to study the lithium adsorption on defective single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). The article considers SWCNTs (7,7) with divacancy defects (2V defect) in the model with periodic boundary conditions. Due to the use of these conditions, the article discusses the problem of proper sizing of the defective tube fragment subject to modeling. Special attention is paid to the search for stable equilibrium positions (adsorption sites) for the lithium atom interacting with the defective tube and the evaluation of the configurations with the lowest energy of these sites. It is shown that all the adsorption sites located near the defect within the first three environments of carboatomic 6-rings are more energetically favorable for adsorption than the adsorption sites on the defectless tube section. Most energetically favorable are the sites above the 8- and 5-rings forming the 2V-defect. During external adsorption, the adsorption site occurs above each 6-ring within the defect. During internal adsorption, most of the 6-rings of the first defect coordination environment cannot keep the lithium atom rolling down into the defect area. The identified regularities are of direct interest in relation to the search for perspective materials for lithium-ion batteries.},

abstract = {Galvanic replacement, one of the popular strategies for producing hollow metallic nanostructures, has enjoyed great success in the past. However, it is rarely used with Au nanoparticles as the self-sacrificed templates, even though these nanoparticles can be produced with well-controlled size, shape, and structure. Here, both Ag and Au from the core–shell Au@Ag nanorods are demonstrated to be involved in the galvanic replacement for producing hollow nanostructures. The enhanced oxidation of metallic Au could be attributed to the close contact between Au and Ag and the unique charge compensation from Au to Ag, both of which are indispensable for the etching of Au via galvanic replacement. As a result of this reaction, these bimetallic nanorods experience a structural evolution from nanorattles, to tip-empty nanorods, and eventually to porous nanotubes. The nanotubes exhibit high catalytic activities in the electrooxidation of formic acid. These results not only disclose the underlying mechanism by which metallic Au could be replaced under mild conditions, but also expand the selection of self-sacrificed templates for galvanic replacement, which is an important reaction in many applications.

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are a versatile material in which many aspects of condensed matter physics come together. Recent discoveries, enabled by sophisticated fabrication, have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our understanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin and valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding of transport through nanotube devices. Unlike conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular momentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and from valley freedom. We focus on the interplay between the two. In single quantum dots defined in short lengths of nanotube, the energy levels associated with each degree of freedom, and the spin-orbit coupling between them, are revealed by Coulomb blockade spectroscopy. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers modifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade. This can be exploited to read out spin and valley qubits, and to measure the decay of these states through coupling to nuclear spins and phonons. A second unique property of carbon nanotubes is that the combination of valley freedom and electron-electron interactions in one dimension strongly modifies their transport behaviour. Interaction between electrons inside and outside a quantum dot is manifested in SU(4) Kondo behavior and level renormalization. Interaction within a dot leads to Wigner molecules and more complex correlated states. This review takes an experimental perspective informed by recent advances in theory. As well as the well-understood overall picture, we also state clearly open questions for the field. These advances position nanotubes as a leading system for the study of spin and valley physics in one dimension where electronic disorder and hyperfine interaction can both be reduced to a very low level.},

Another valuable tool is the semiclassical approximation to the single-particle density matrix, which gives a theoretical framework to connect the properties of large clusters with the bulk and macroscopic surface properties. The physical properties discussed in this review are the ground-state binding energies, the ionization potentials, and the dipole polarizabilities.

abstract = {The lack of description of van der Waals interactions in layered materials such as graphite and binary graphite intercalation compounds remains a main drawback of conventional density functional theory. Two fundamentally different approaches to overcome this issue are the employment of semiempirical dispersion correction scheme such as Grimme dispersion correction or nonlocal density functionals. We carefully compare these two approaches for the description of the geometric structure and the thermodynamic stability of pure graphite and Li-GICs at different lithium concentrations and stages. Based on the computed formation energies, we also evaluate the lithium-graphite intercalation potential. We find that PBE-D3(BJ) accurately reproduces the lattice parameters and the interlayer binding energy of graphite, although it underestimates the thermodynamic stability of stage-II Li-GICs mainly due to overbinding of carbon atoms in pure graphite. The nonlocal van der Waals functionals optB88-vdW, optB86b-vdW, and revPBE-vdW show a good agreement with experiments concerning stability of Li-GICs of different stages, although they overestimate the van der Waals interactions in graphite. The experimentally determined decreasing step-function behavior of Li-graphite intercalation potential can be qualitatively reproduced only by employing the revPBE van der Waals functional, whereas the other density functionals fail in the description. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In complicated cases of noncovalent interactions with `hole-to-hole' of S and I orientations, distinguishing the chalcogen and halogen bonds is only possible if the atom is uniquely determined, which also provides the electrophilic site.

While the nucleation occurs more readily with increasing Li concentration, possibly leading to the dendrite formation and failure of the Li-ion battery, the existence of the barrier delays nucleation and may allow Li storage on graphene. Our electronic structure and charge transfer analyses reveal how the fully ionized Li adatoms transform to metallic Li during the cluster growth on graphene.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the characteristics of graphene oxide (GO) for Bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption in water. Batch experiments on the influence of significant parameters were performed. While an improvement of the adsorption capacity of BPA was obtained by the increment of contact time and the initial BPA concentration, the increment of pH above 8, GO dosage, and temperature showed the reverse results. The thermodynamic study suggested that BPA adsorption on GO was an exothermic and spontaneous process. The kinetics was explained by the pseudo-second-order model which covers all steps of adsorption. The fit of the results with the Langmuir isotherm indicated the monolayer adsorption. At 298 K, the adsorption reached equilibrium within 30 min with the maximum adsorption capacity of 49.26 mg/g. The low BPA adsorption capacity of GO can be interpreted by the occurrence of oxygen-containing functional groups (OCFGs) that are able to form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding OCFGs and water molecules. This effect inhibited the role of $\pi$ – $\pi$ interactions that are mainly responsible for the adsorption of BPA.},

We found that the tip-suspended Ag−Au and Cu−Au alloy NTs were stable structures due to the existence of local minima in both the binding energies and the string tensions variation with their unit-cell lengths and that the stability was enhanced when the content of Au was increased. However, a tip-suspended Cu−Ag alloy NT would be difficult to form in future experiments. We also found that both the relativistic effect of elemental gold and the string tension applied by the tip contacts play important roles in suppressing effectively the self-purification effect, leading to the formation of these coinage alloy NTs. The quantum conductance of the stable alloy NTs is increased by 1G 0 as compared with that of the corresponding pure coinage-metal NTs.},

abstract = {Theoretical investigations are made on adsorption and diffusion of atoms/ions on graphene surface based on an analytical continuous model. An atom/ion interacts with every carbon atom of graphene through a pairwise potential which can be approximated by the Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. Using the Fourier expansion of the interaction potential, the total interaction energy between the adsorption atom/ion and a monolayer graphene is derived. The energy-distance relationships in the normal and lateral directions for varied atoms/ions, including gold atom (Au), platinum atom (Pt), manganese ion (Mn2+), sodium ion (Na1+), and lithium-ion (Li1+), on monolayer graphene surface are analyzed. The equilibrium position and binding energy of the atoms/ions at three particular adsorption sites (hollow, bridge, and top) are calculated, and the adsorption stability is discussed. The results show that H-site is the most stable adsorption site, which is in agreement with the results of other literatures. What is more, the periodic interaction energy and interaction forces of lithium-ion diffusing along specific paths on graphene surface are also obtained and analyzed. The minimum energy barrier for diffusion is calculated. The possible applications of present study include drug delivery system (DDS), atomic scale friction, rechargeable lithium-ion graphene battery, and energy storage in carbon materials.},

We found a vast number of isomers within a small energy range above the respective putative global minima with each method. Photoelectron spectroscopy of Au26 - under different experimental conditions revealed definitive evidence of the presence of multiple isomers, consistent with the theoretical predictions. Comparison between the experimental and simulated photoelectron spectra suggests that the photoelectron spectra of Au26- contain a mixture of three isomers, all of which are low-symmetry core-shell-type nanoclusters with a single internal Au atom. We present a disconnectivity graph for Au26- that has been computed completely at the density functional level.

Ishii et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 18 (2016) 10411–10418]. We use density functional theory (DFT) to theoretically investigate (i) the electronic and structural states of SWCNT-encapsulated quinone with or without Li and (ii) the Li insertion and extraction dynamics in the system. Substantial electron transfer from the quinone molecules to the SWCNT is thereby observed. This electron transfer stabilizes the positively charged quinone molecules in the negatively charged SWCNT through Coulomb attraction and decreases the electronic band gap for the SWCNT with semiconductor chirality. In the case of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PhQ), we observe that the cross-sectional shape of the SWCNT changes substantially in the relaxed state depending on the extent of Li insertion: the SWCNT exhibits a circular cylinder shape when no Li is present, whereas it is flattened upon sufficient Li insertion. These SWCNT shapes well reflect the aggregated shapes of PhQ molecules, which depend on the amount of Li inserted. As for the Li insertion and extraction dynamics, we find that the Li atoms can take either of two paths: one is along the SWCNT wall, and the other involves hopping on the PhQ molecules and/or the sites where the C atoms of the SWCNT and the O atoms of PhQ molecules contact each other. The Li-transfer rate on the SWCNT wall is large; hence, the hopping is the rate-limiting step.},

Our results on Young's modulus, fracture strain, and fracture strength of bulk graphene are in reasonable agreement with the recently published experimental data. Our results indicate that fracture strain and fracture strength of bulk graphene under uniaxial tension can have a significant dependence on the chirality. Mechanical properties such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio can depend strongly on the size and chirality of the graphene nanoribbon.},

abstract = {Portable-electronics epitomizing technological breakthrough in history of mankind, are universal reality thanks to rechargeable batteries. LIBs, lithium-ion batteries, owing to high-reversible capacity, high-power capability, good-safety, long-life and zero-memory effects are at the heart of this revolution. Nonetheless, longer-battery-life, higher-current- and power-density, better-safety, and flexibility, crucial for portables and hybrid-electric-vehicles further fuel the research to better their electrochemistry. Electrode materials are vital for performance of batteries. Recent developments in nanoscience and nanotechnology offer potential prospects to devise novel-nanostructured electrode materials for next-generation better-performing LIBs. Nanostructured materials are pivotal to these progresses due to their manageable surface-area, stunted mass and charge-diffusion span, and volume change acclimatization during charging/discharging. CNTs, carbon-nanotubes, with distinct 1D-tubular structure, excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, mechanical flexibility and significantly large surface-area, are considered ideal additives to enrich electrodes??? chemistry. Here, we observe contemporary developments in synthesis and characterization of CNTs and CNTs-based nanostructured composite-electrodes for utilization in LIBs.},

abstract = {A Monte Carlo method is used to calculate various properties of one-band Gutzwiller wave functions which are formed by restricting the charge fluctuations in noninteracting wave functions. Gutzwillers approximate formula for the kinetic energy is tested both for the ground state and excited states. The ground state is found to have strong antiferromagnetic short-range spin-spin correlations for nearly-half-filled bands, thus extending previous work on the half-filled case. These correlations are very sensitive to the choice of occupied Bloch states and when the occupation is distributed uniformly over the band they disappear. From this fact we conclude that correlations are present only at temperatures low compared to the coherence temperature. In the almost-localized limit it is advantageous to describe the system by an effective Hamiltonian which separates into a term due to the kinetic energy of the charge carriers and one due to the Heisenberg spin-spin coupling. We show that the almost-localized Fermi liquid can gain energy from both terms in the effective Hamiltonian. In other words the restrictions on charge fluctuations can cause spin correlations which in turn can stabilize the Fermi-liquid ground state. {\textcopyright} 1987 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We propose a simple analytic representation of the correlation energy ɛc for a uniform electron gas, as a function of density parameter rs and relative spin polarization $\zeta$. Within the random-phase approximation (RPA), this representation allows for the r−3/4s behavior as rs→∞. Close agreement with numerical RPA values for ɛc(rs,0), ɛc(rs,1), and the spin stiffness $\alpha$c(rs)=∂2ɛc(rs, $\zeta$=0)/$\delta$$\zeta$2, and recovery of the correct rslnrs term for rs→0, indicate the appropriateness of the chosen analytic form. Beyond RPA, different parameters for the same analytic form are found by fitting to the Green's-function Monte Carlo data of Ceperley and Alder [Phys. Rev. Lett. 45, 566 (1980)], taking into account data uncertainties that have been ignored in earlier fits by Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN) [Can. J. Phys. 58, 1200 (1980)] or by Perdew and Zunger (PZ) [Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)]. While we confirm the practical accuracy of the VWN and PZ representations, we eliminate some minor problems with these forms. We study the $\zeta$-dependent coefficients in the high- and low-density expansions, and the rs-dependent spin susceptibility. We also present a conjecture for the exact low-density limit. The correlation potential $\mu$$\sigma$c(rs,$\zeta$) is evaluated for use in self-consistent density-functional calculations.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a candidate electrode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Tailoring CNTs to shorter tubes with open ends can enhance the lithium capacity. Recently, the carbon nanobelt (CNB) has been successfully synthesized. This work concentrates on ab initio modelling of lithium adsorption on short open-ended CNTs with different lengths based on density functional theory (DFT). Li atoms adsorbed on CNB (one-segment (6,6) CNT) and short (6,6) CNTs with 2–12 segments as well as periodical CNTs were modelled. The most stable Li-CNT configurations were obtained after the total system energies were minimized. Lithium adsorption energies of short CNTs were found to have a regular oscillatory dependence on the number of segments along tube axis. Energetics for lithium moving across the tube wall and along the tube axis were also calculated for open-ended CNTs. Ab initio molecular dynamics (ABMD) was performed to simulate the lithium diffusion behaviors in short CNTs. Among all short CNTs, the CNT with 2 segments was the most promising electrode material for LIBs and its lithium capacity was finally predicted.},

abstract = {We present the Voronoi Deformation Density (VDD) method for computing atomic charges. The VDD method does not explicitly use the basis functions but calculates the amount of electronic density that flows to or from a certain atom due to bond formation by spatial integration of the deformation density over the atomic Voronoi cell. We compare our method to the well-known Mulliken, Hirshfeld, Bader, and Weinhold [Natural Population Analysis (NPA)] charges for a variety of biological, organic, and inorganic molecules. The Mulliken charges are (again) shown to be useless due to heavy basis set dependency, and the Bader charges (and often also the NPA charges) are not realistic, yielding too extreme values that suggest much ionic character even in the case of covalent bonds. The Hirshfeld and VDD charges, which prove to be numerically very similar, are to be recommended because they yield chemically meaningful charges. We stress the need to use spatial integration over an atomic domain to get rid of basis set dependency, and the need to integrate the deformation density in order to obtain a realistic picture of the charge rearrangement upon bonding. An asset of the VDD charges is the transparency of the approach owing to the simple geometric partitioning of space. The deformation density based charges prove to conform to chemical experience.},

abstract = {Although the adsorption of organic contaminants on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the dispersion of CNTs have been extensively investigated separately, the adsorption behavior of organic contaminants on dispersed CNTs, which may be a missing link to understanding their environmental behavior and risks, remain unclear yet rarely studied. In this study, the effect of the dispersing agent structure on the adsorption characteristics of BPA (a representative organic contaminant) on dispersed CNTs were investigated using tannic acid (TA), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and gallic acid (GA) as model dispersing agents. Our results showed that at low dispersing agent concentrations, adsorption of TA could lead to higher CNT suspension than adsorption of SDBS and GA due to greater steric hindrance. However, the presence of TA reduced the adsorption of BPA due to strong competitive adsorption on dispersed CNTs. At high concentrations of TA, the suspension of CNTs was reduced by the “bridging effect,” in which adjacent dispersed CNTs form hydrogen bonds and re-aggregate. However, the adsorption of BPA dramatically increased due to the enhanced partition of BPA into pseudomicelles of TA on dispersed CNTs, as indicated by the significantly increased index of heterogeneity at high TA concentration. Transmission electron microscopy images confirmed the formation of TA pseudomicelles. This study highlights the key role of the dispersing agent structure on CNT dispersion and adsorption of organic contaminants. The high mobility and transport of CNT-adsorbed contaminants may lead to higher environmental risks compared with aggregated CNTs.},

@article{Molcanov2019,
abstract = {The present review is aimed to compare crystal packing interactions contributing to stacking arrangements of primarily nonaromatic systems referring only briefly to classical aromatic stacking. The classical aromatic stacking is mainly based on weak dispersion interactions (E ≤ 1 kcal mol-1) whereas heteroaromatics reveal more electrostatic (or specifically dipolar) contributions (E = 5-10 kcal mol-1). Based mainly on our charge density studies and DFT calculations, the results show that (i) all planar rings stack, regardless of aromaticity (or delocalization of $\pi$electrons) and (ii) stacking interactions cover a wide continuum ranging from weak, mainly dispersion interactions (E < 5 kcal mol-1) to unlocalized two-electron multicentric (2e/mc) covalent bonds ("pancake bonds", E > 15 kcal mol-1). Our recent studies showed that quinones form face-to-face stacks and the energies of interactions exceed 10 kcal mol-1 ours and other authors' results indicate that interactions between planar radicals involve a significant contribution of covalent bonding. Thus, $\pi$-interactions cover a broad range of energies, ranging from ≤1 to ≥20 kcal mol-1, and the interactions span from weak dispersion to multicentric covalent bonding. Therefore, development of a universal model of stacking is needed. In this respect, stacking can be compared to hydrogen bonding, which also ranges between dispersion (weakest hydrogen bonds, such as C-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}S and C-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}Cl) and two-electron/three-centric covalent bonding (the strongest "symmetrical" hydrogen bonds).},

abstract = {This critical review deals with the history of Au55(PPh3)12Cl6 and its derivatives from the very beginning in 1981 to date. Au55 clusters obtain their special interest from their ultimate size and their ideal cuboctahedral structure. They are part of the family of so-called full-shell clusters, particles with perfectly completed geometries, also represented by icosahedral Au13 clusters. Bare as well as ligand protected Au55 clusters not only exhibit special chemical and physical stability, but draw their attention particularly from their unique electronic properties. Single electron switching at room temperature becomes possible, giving rise for development of applications in future nanoelectronic devices. A predominantly size-determined property of the 1.4 nm particles becomes obvious with respect of biological response. Au55 clusters indicate an unusual cytotoxicity which seems to be caused by the unusually strong interaction between the 1.4 nm particles and the major grooves of DNA. Only marginally smaller or larger particles show drastically reduced toxicity, whereas significantly larger gold nanoparticles are completely non-toxic. Both, the electronic perspectives as well as the relevance in toxicology are at very early stages of development (75 references). {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.},

@article{Bader2009,
abstract = {This account takes to task papers that criticize the definition of a bond path as a criterion for the bonding between the atoms it links by mistakenly identifying it with a chemical bond. It is argued that the notion of a chemical bond is too restrictive to account for the physics underlying the broad spectrum of interactions between atoms and molecules that determine the properties of matter. A bond path on the other hand, as well as being accessible to experimental verification and subject to the theorems of quantum mechanics, is applicable to any and all of the interactions that account for the properties of matter. It is shown that one may define a bond path operator as a Dirac observable, making the bond path the measurable expectation value of a quantum mechanical operator. Particular attention is given to van der Waals interactions that traditionally are assumed to represent attractive interactions that are distinct from chemical bonding. They are assumed by some to act in concert with Pauli repulsions to account for the existence of condensed states of molecules. It is such dichotomies of interpretation that are resolved by the experimental detection of bond paths and the delineation of their properties in molecular crystals. Specific criticisms of the stabilization afforded by the presence of bond paths derived from spectroscopic measurements performed on dideuteriophenanthrene are shown to be physically unsound. The concept of a bond path as a "bridge of density" linking bonded atoms was introduced by London in 1928 following the definition of the electron density by Schr{\"{o}}dinger in 1926. These papers marked the beginning of the theory of atoms in molecules linked by bond paths. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

The various types of Raman scattering processes relevant to carbon nanotubes are reviewed, and the theoretical foundations for these topics are presented. The most common experimental techniques used to probe carbon nanotubes are summarized, followed by a review of the novel experimental findings for each of the features in the first order and second order Raman spectra for single wall carbon nanotubes. These results are presented and discussed in connection with theoretical considerations. Raman spectra for bundles of SWNTs, for SWNTs surrounded by various common wrapping agents, and for isolated SWNTs at the single nanotube level are reviewed. Some of the current research challenges facing the field are briefly summarized.},

abstract = {The strength of a bond, defined as p=s/r, where s is the Pauling bond strength and r is the row number of an M cation bonded to an oxide anion, is related to a build-up of electron density along the MO bonds in a relatively large number of oxide and hydroxyacid molecules, three oxide minerals and three molecular crystals. As p increases, the value of the electron density is observed to increase at the bond critical points with the lengths of the bonds shortening and the electronegativities of the M cations bonded to the oxide anion increasing. The assertion that the covalency of a bond is intrinsically connected to its bond strength is supported by the electron density distribution and its bond critical point properties. A connection also exists between the properties of the electron density distributions and the connectivity of the bond strength network formed by the bonded atoms of a structure.},

abstract = {In this study, carbon nanotube (CNT) film anodes are prepared for use in flexible lithium ion batteries, and the electrochemical performance of the CNT film anodes is evaluated. The CNT films are synthesized via chemical vapor deposition and direct spinning. The films are heat-treated under a nitrogen atmosphere at a high temperature to study the effects of heat treatment on the battery performance. The electrodes made with the CNT films are characterized via charge–discharge test, cyclic voltammetry, and impedance measurement. The results indicate that batteries with films heat-treated under a nitrogen atmosphere show a higher capacity, which can be a result of their high crystalline perfection. The impedance analysis shows that a lower resistance at the interface can be obtained by using heat-treated films. The charge–discharge tests are carried out by adjusting the rate from C/2 to 10C, and when the rate slows from 10C to 1C, the capacity of the samples largely recovers. The nitrogen/heat-treated CNT film electrodes present a capacity that is twice as high, such as 2C, 5C, and 10C, than untreated CNT film electrodes. These results indicate that the carbon nanotube film anodes have high potential for use in portable and wearable computers due to their flexibility.},

We describe the dependence of the critical exponents that drive their long-distance asymptotics on the Coulomb coupling, the density, and h. This dependence can be described in terms of a set of coupled Bethe-Ansatz integral equations. It simplifies significantly in the strong-coupling limit, where we give explicit formulas for the dependence of the critical exponents on the magnetic field. In particular, we find that at small field the functional dependence of the critical exponents on h can be algebraic or logarithmic depending on the operators involved. In addition, we evaluate the singularities of the Fourier images of the correlation functions. It turns out that switching on a magnetic field gives rise to singularities in the dynamic field-field correlation functions that are absent at h=0. {\textcopyright} 1991 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes can be utilized in several ways to enhance the performance of silicon-based anodes. In the present work, thermally carbonized mesoporous silicon (TCPSi) microparticles and single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are conjugated to create a hybrid material that performs as the Li-ion battery anode better than the physical mixture of TCPSi and CNTs. It is found out that the way the conjugation is done has an essential role in the performance of the anode. The conjugation should be made between negatively charged TCPSi and positively charged CNTs. Based on the electrochemical experiments it is concluded that the positive charges, i.e., excess amine groups of the hybrid material interfere with the diffusion of the lithium cations and thus they should be removed from the anode. Through the saturation of the excess positive amine groups on the CNTs with succinic anhydride, the performance of the hybrid material is even further enhanced.},

abstract = {Many people in the materials science and solid-state community are familiar with the acronym "DFT+U." For those less familiar, this technique uses ideas from model Hamiltonians that permit the description of both metals and insulators to address problems of electron over-delocalization in practical implementations of density functional theory (DFT). Exchange-correlation functionals in DFT are often described as belonging to a hierarchical "Jacob's ladder" of increasing accuracy in moving from local to non-local descriptions of exchange and correlation. DFT+U is not on this "ladder" but rather acts as an "elevator" because it systematically tunes relative energetics, typically on a localized subshell (e.g., d or f electrons), regardless of the underlying functional employed. However, this tuning is based on a metric of the local electron density of the subshells being addressed, thus necessitating physical or chemical or intuition about the system of interest. I will provide a brief overview of the history of how DFT+U came to be starting from the origin of the Hubbard and Anderson model Hamiltonians. This history lesson is necessary because it permits us to make the connections between the "Hubbard U" and fundamental outstanding challenges in electronic structure theory, and it helps to explain why this method is so widely applied to transition-metal oxides and organometallic complexes alike.},

We find good agreement between both. Visualizing the local device density of states of the systems gives a descriptive link between electronic structure and transport properties. In comparison with bare finite and infinite tubes, we show that the electronic structure of short metallic CNTs is strongly modified by the presence of the metallic electrodes, which leads to pronounced size effects in the conductance. The mean conductances and linear response currents allow a ranking of the metals regarding their ability to form low-Ohmic contacts with the nanotube: Ag <$\sim$ Au < Cu << Pt $\sim$$\sim$ Pd << Al. These findings are contrasted with similar trends in contact distance, binding energy, calculated work function of the metal surfaces, and various results from literature.},

It has been found that several kinds of the SWGNTs can indeed be formed, which are identified as (3,3), (4,3), and (5,3) ones, depending mainly on the diameter of confined carbon nanotube. Also, the liquid-solid phase transition forming the SWGNTs is found to be a first order with their melting temperature lower than that of the bulk gold materials. And their solidification temperature Ts depends on both of the gold tube's length and diameter, which is greatly different from the multi-layer gold nanowires (GNWs).

abstract = {Here, a method is described for easily building three-carbon nanotube junctions. It allows the geometry to be found and bond connectivity of C(3) symmetric nanotube junctions to be established. Such junctions may present a variable degree of pyramidalization and are composed of three identical carbon nanotubes with arbitrary chirality. From the indices of the target nanotube, applying the formulas of strip algebra, the possible positions of the six defects (heptagonal rings) needed can be found. Given the multiple possibilities that arise for a specific pair of indices, the relation between the macroscopic geometry (interbranch angles, junction size, and pyramidalization) and each specific solution is found. To automate the construction of these structures, we implemented this algorithm with CoNTub software, version 2.0, which is available at ( http://www.ugr.es/local/gmdm/contub2 ). In addition, a classification of three-nanotube junctions, 3TJ, in seven types based on the location of defects has been proposed, i.e. 3TJ(0:0:6), 3TJ(0:1:5), 3TJ(0:2:4), 3TJ(0:3:3), 3TJ(1:1:4), 3TJ(1:2:3), and 3TJ(2:2:2) types.},

The optimal structure of these systems are derived from total energy minimization using a convenient Lennard-Jones expression of the van der Waals intermolecular potential. The Raman spectra have been calculated as a function of nanotube diameter and fullerene concentration using the bond polarizability model combined with the spectral moment method. These results should be useful for the interpretation of the experimental Raman spectra of boron nitride nanotubes encasing C60 and C70 fullerenes.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce AIM-UC, a free application that allows to create graphs related to Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). The input data are files that contain 3D grid of electron density, in some known formats: CUBE from gaussian, grd from DMol and CHGCAR from VASP. Also it supports wave function files from AIMPAC. The application calculates 2D regular grids (electron densities and its laplacians) in a plane positioned by the user. By using bicubic interpolation and the Newton-Raphson method, the critical points at the plane can be calculated, and the gradient field and molecular graph can also be generated using the Cash-Karp Runge-Kutta method. It also permits plotting the electron density and its negative laplacian on the selected plane. Moreover, for both 2D grids, it is possible to calculate the contour maps using the "Marching Squares" algorithm. This application also permits finding the critical points in the 3D space. The output consist of plain text files and images in PNG, BMP and EPS (encapsulated post script) formats. AIM-UC was programmed in C++, using the GUI toolkit FLTK (fast light toolkit) and OpenGL (open graphic library). {\textcopyright} 2014-IOS Press.},

The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is considered for the exchange-correlation functional. The results show that the armchair CNT is a metal, whereas the armchair GaNNT is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap. We can find the optical properties strongly depending on direction of polarization of light, hence the dielectric function and the optical absorption spectra are different for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to tubes axis. The significant peaks in the considered parameters are related to the ultraviolet to infrared (UV-IR) spectral region, and their intensities depend on the tubular morphology of the tubes. Our results can serve as a base for developments in designing nano-electronic and nano-optoelectronics devices. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With Adobe Sign, you can comply with laws and regulatory guidelines-using one scalable signature solution. Government organizations around the world are actively transforming their agency businesses, using digital technologies to deliver agility, efficiency, cost savings and superior constituent experiences. Document signature processes represent one of the biggest opportunities to accelerate this transformation. Government workers spend countless hours hunting down approvals and ink signatures-and then print, scan, fax or mail documents to get the job done. The resulting delays frustrate citizens, departments, suppliers and employees alike. It's little wonder that government organizations have embraced electronic and digital signatures. Today, leading agencies such as the State of Hawaii and the Western Australian Local Government Association (WALGA) get fast, legal and secure signatures electronically. The results are impressive. WALGA has reduced their average time to have contracts signed from 2 weeks or longer to just 80 minutes. The biggest question today isn't whether to adopt electronic signatures-it's how to go about it. While the terms may seem similar, electronic and digital signatures actually describe two different approaches to signing documents-and those differences are linked with signature laws and regulatory requirements. To make the right choice for your agency, you'll want to learn about those differences, understand your unique legal or regulatory environment, and partner with a company you trust-to help you deliver value today and into the future. This paper explores electronic and digital signatures and shows how Adobe solutions let you work with either approach, or a combination of the two. Adobe Sign is an Adobe Document Cloud solution that manages signature processes from end to end, integrates easily with existing government processes and provides a quick return on investment. With over 20 years of experience developing and refining PDF and signature technologies, Adobe is uniquely positioned to help your agency signature processes in compliance with local and global laws as well as regulatory guidelines.},

In the future, biosensor development will become even more crucial due to the demand for personalized-medicine, point-of care devices and cheaper diagnostic tools. Substantial advances in sensor technology are often fueled by the advent of new materials. Therefore, nanomaterials have motivated a large body of research and such materials have been implemented into biosensor devices. Among these new materials carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are especially promising building blocks for biosensors due to their unique electronic and optical properties. Carbon nanotubes are rolled-up cylinders of carbon monolayers (graphene). They can be chemically modified in such a way that biologically relevant molecules can be detected with high sensitivity and selectivity. In this review article we will discuss how carbon nanotubes can be used to create biosensors. We review the latest advancements of optical carbon nanotube based biosensors with a special focus on near-infrared (NIR)-fluorescence, Raman-scattering and fluorescence quenching. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction are highly desirable for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Herein, a kind of carbon nanotube (CNT) supported single-site Fe-N-C catalyst was fabricated via pyrolyzing in-situ grown Fe-containing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks on CNTs. CNTs not only serve as the physical supports of the Fe-N-C active sites but also provide a conductive network to facilitate the fast electron and ion transfer. The as-synthesized catalysts exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.865 V for oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential of 0.442 V at 10 mA{\textperiodcentered}cm−2 for oxygen evolution, which is 310 mV smaller than that of Fe-N-C without CNTs. The rechargeable Zn-air batteries fabricated with such hybrid catalysts display a high peak power density of 182 mW{\textperiodcentered}cm−2 and an excellent cycling stability of over 1,000 h at 10 mA{\textperiodcentered}cm−2, which outperforms commercial Pt-C and most of the reported catalysts. This facile strategy of combining single-site Metal-N-C with CNTs network is effective for preparing highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is known as a promising pseudocapacitive material, but low conductivity limits its applications. Hydrogenation is demonstrated to increase the conductivity of MoO3 and hence improve its electrochemical performance. Hydrogenated MoO3 (MoO3−x) shows enhanced conductivity based on, both first principle calculations and single nanobelt measurements. Freestanding MoO3−x/carbon nanotubes (CNT) composite films have been fabricated and showed much improved electrochemical performance compared to composites of CNT and as-synthesized MoO3 (MoO3/CNT). Electrodes showed a specific capacitance of 337F/g (based on the mass of MoO3−x) and a high volumetric capacitance of 291F/cm3 (based on the whole electrode) with excellent rate capability. Also we confirmed that the improved intercalation kinetics and the increased intercalation pseudocapacitance could be attributed to the higher electronic conductivity of MoO3−x, which results in better and faster intercalations of Li+ ions. This electrochemical behavior implies that MoO3−x can serve as a very good negative electrode with high capacitance at high mass loading levels.},

abstract = {Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combines the spectral selectivity of laser excitation with the high resolution of ultrasound imaging, representing a noninvasive modality that holds remarkable potential for clinical translation. In particular, multispectral optoacoustic tomography has emerged has an innovative PAI technology, which enables high detection specificity by resolving multiple spectral signatures through tissues and accurately decomposing the biodistribution of relevant molecules from non-specific background contributions. Key criteria for developing PAI contrast agents include strong absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) tissue transparent region and low toxicity. In this study, we have fabricated gold nanotubes (Au NTs) with controlled length and NIR absorption for the application as in vivo MSOT contrast agents. The length control relies on the synthesis of silver nanorod template under certain growth conditions. The Au NTs were coated with a layer of biocompatible polymer, poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), to ensure colloidal stability and low cytotoxicity. The PSS-Au NTs have shown excellent MSOT signal enhancement on tissue-mimicking phantom and in vivo, demonstrating the potential for further development towards a theranostic nanoplatform integrating PAI capability and therapeutic functions.},

abstract = {Thermodynamical properties of canonical and grand-canonical ensembles of the half-filled two-site Hubbard model have been discussed within the framework of the nonextensive statistics (NES). For relating the physical temperature T to the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$, two methods have been adopted: T=1/kB$\beta$ in method A [Tsallis et al., Physica A 261 (1998) 534], and T=cq/kB$\beta$ in method B [Abe et al., Phys. Lett. A 281 (2001) 126], where kB denotes the Boltzman constant, cq=∑ipiq,pi the probability distribution of the ith state, and q the entropic index. Temperature dependences of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility have been calculated for 1≤q≤2, the conventional Boltzman-Gibbs statistics being recovered in the limit of q=1. The Curie constant $\Gamma$q of the susceptibility in the atomic and low-temperature limits (t/U→0,T/U→0) is shown to be given by $\Gamma$q=2q22(q-1) in method A, and $\Gamma$q=2q in method B, where t stands for electron hoppings and U intra-atomic interaction in the Hubbard model. These expressions for $\Gamma$q are shown to agree with the results of a free spin model which have been studied also by the NES with methods A and B. A comparison has been made between the results for canonical and grand-canonical ensembles of the model. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Optical spectroscopy can thereby be used to rapidly determine the detailed composition of bulk SWNT samples, providing distributions in both tube diameter and chiral angle. The measured transition frequencies differ substantially from simple theoretical predictions. These deviations may reflect combinations of trigonal warping and excitonic effects.},

abstract = {Several researchers share their perspective on the status and challenges faced by the carbon science in 2016. In addition to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and hydrosolvo/thermal processes, alternative innovative growth techniques of these hypothetical 3D solids should now be a focus for carbon researchers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that graphene nanoribbons with specific diameters and nanotubes with desired helicity could be synthesized by careful polymerization of aromatic molecules. New theoretical studies using the nanotube/catalyst interface thermodynamics and the kinetic growth theories have widened the understanding of chirality selectivity towards near-armchair tubes. In 2013, a novel method based on aqueous-two polymer phase separation has emerged as an easily accessible and versatile approach for sorting nanotubes which is promising for low-cost scalable production of high-purity SWCNTs. Gel chromatograph based separation methods have also yielded high-purity single chirality optical isomers. New carbon materials are key components in alternative energy technologies that include electrodes for batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and electrolytic cells for hydrogen production from water. They are also of interest as transparent conductors in solar cells, bipolar plates in fuel cells, lightweight materials that save energy in aircraft and automotive operations, and catalysts or catalyst supports for energy transformations that include carbon dioxide reduction into fuels and commercial chemicals.},

Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle- Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.},

abstract = {We investigate the influence of the effect of dynamic polarization of the carbon atom valence electrons on the angular distributions of protons channeled in (6, 4)@(11, 9) double-wall carbon nanotubes. The proton velocities are 3 and 5 a.u., corresponding to energies of 0.223 and 0.621 MeV, while the nanotube lengths are 0.1–0.2 lm. The interaction between a proton and the nanotube atoms is described by the Doyle–Turner potential whereas the image force acting on the proton is calculated by a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the dynamic response of the nanotube valence electrons. The angular distributions of channeled protons are generated by a computer simulation method using the numerical solution of the proton equations of motion in the transverse plane. Our analysis shows that the image force induces additional extrema in the proton deflection functions, giving rise to the rainbow maxima in the angular distributions that do not exist when the proton is subject to the atomic force only. These maxima could be used to probe the total interaction potential in proton channeling in nanotubes.},

abstract = {We have performed first principles calculations of Li and Li+ adsorbed on the sidewall of carbon nanotubes. Density functional theory based on the B3LYP functional and all-electron basis set centered on atoms was employed. Carbon nanotubes were modeled by varying the diameter ranging from the chiral vector (6, 0) to (12, 0), and by varying the tubule length for the nanotubes having chiral vector (9, 0) from 1 to 3 unit cells. Based on the study of potential energy surface, it was found that the Li atom and cation prefer to localize near the carbon nanotube sidewall and that surface diffusion of Li/Li+ can easily take place along the internal sidewall, while being hindered for the external sidewall. Binding energies tend to depend on the configuration, i.e., on being odd or even for the chiral vector (m, 0), rather than on the diameter size. In addition, they depend on the tubule length but converge rapidly after 3 unit cells. The atomic net charge (natural bond orbital and Mulliken population analysis) on the lithium inside carbon nanotube does not depend on whether the Li-CNT is neutral or charged. The results of this study may be helpful for understanding the fundamentals of how the Li-ion carbon nanotube battery works. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Net atomic charges (NACs) are widely used throughout the chemical sciences to concisely summarize key information about charge transfer between atoms in materials. The vast majority of NAC definitions proposed to date are unsuitable for describing the wide range of material types encountered across the chemical sciences. In this article, we show the DDEC6 method reproduces important chemical, theoretical, and experimental properties across an extremely broad range of material types including small and large molecules, organometallics, nanoclusters, porous solids, nonporous solids, and solid surfaces. Some important comparisons we make are: (a) correlations between various NAC models and spectroscopically measured core-electron binding energy shifts for Ti-, Fe-, and Mo-containing solids, (b) comparisons between DDEC6 and experimentally extracted NACs for formamide and natrolite, (c) comparisons of accuracy of different NAC methods for reproducing the electrostatic potential surrounding a material across one and multiple system conformations, (d) comparisons between calculated and chemically expected electron transfer trends for atoms in numerous dense solids, solid surfaces, and molecules, (e) an assessment of NAC transferability between three crystal phases of the diisopropylammonium bromide organic ferroelectric, and (f) comparisons between DDEC6 and polarized neutron diffraction atomic spin moments for the Mn12-acetate single-molecule magnet. We find the DDEC6 NACs are ideally suited for constructing flexible force-fields and give reasonable agreement with force-fields commonly used to simulate biomolecules and water. We find the DDEC6 method is more accurate than the DDEC3 method for analyzing a broad range of materials. This broad applicability to periodic and non-periodic materials irrespective of the basis set type makes the DDEC6 method suited for use as a default atomic population analysis method in quantum chemistry programs.},

We determine the energies of the first optical transition in metallic tubes and of the second optical transition in semiconducting tubes for more than 50 chiral indices. The assignment is unique and does not depend on empirical parameters. The systematics of the so-called branches in the Kataura plot are discussed; many properties of the tubes are similar for members of the same branch. We show how the radial breathing modes observed in a single Raman spectrum can be easily assigned based on these systematics. In addition, empirical fits provide the energies and radial breathing modes for all metallic and semiconducting nanotubes with diameters between 0.6 and 1.5 nm. We discuss the relation between the frequency of the radial breathing mode and tube diameter. Finally, from the Raman intensities we obtain information on the electron-phonon coupling.},

Carbon nanotubes have demonstrated to be very effective buffering components, and can serve as the backbone in nanostructured anode materials since they can alleviate the degradation of the structural integrity that often results from the significant volume change associated with the charging and discharging process.

The nanotubes were treated with oxygen plasma (0.2 mbar) at varied generator power (20–60 W) and exposure time (0.1–30 min). It was found that the work function changes nonmonotonously upon plasma treatment: after significant increase (from 4.5 eV to 5.9 eV) and passing through maximum the work function decreases and finally reaches a plateau. The experimental results supported by DFT calculations allowed to propose a molecular model explaining the changes in carbon nanotube surface induced by oxygen plasma. Two different oxygen adatom locations: out-of-plane (Csurf–Oadatom) and in-plane (Csurf–Osurf–Csurf) were identified, leading to formation of surface dipoles (formation of negative potential barrier, work function increase) and incorporation of oxygen into the carbon structure (cancellation of the potential barrier, work function decrease), respectively.

abstract = {With increasing availability of good all-electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total "gross atomic populations," or into partial and total "net atomic populations" together with "overlap populations." "Gross atomic populations" distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded. Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self-consistent field) LCAO-MO data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s-p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the $\pi$ bonds in CO, the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ overlap populations are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total overlap population for the $\pi$ electrons is about twice that for the $\sigma$ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94% localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.},

abstract = {The $\sigma$- and $\pi$-hole interactions are used to define attractive forces involving elements of groups 12–18 of the periodic table acting as Lewis acids and any electron rich site (Lewis base, anion, and $\pi$-system). When the electrophilic atom belongs to group 14, the resulting interaction is termed a tetrel bond. In the first part of this feature paper, tetrel bonds formed in crystalline solids involving sp3-hybridized carbon atom are described and discussed by using selected structures retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database. The interaction is characterized by a strong directionality (close to linearity) due to the small size of the $\sigma$-hole in the C-atom opposite the covalently bonded electron withdrawing group. The second part describes the utilization of two allotropic forms of carbon (C60 and carbon nanotubes) as supramolecular catalysts based on anion–$\pi$ interactions ($\pi$-hole tetrel bonding). This part emphasizes that the $\pi$-hole, which is considerably more accessible by nucleophiles than the $\sigma$-hole, can be conveniently used in supramolecular catalysis.},

abstract = {The LCAO, or Bloch, or tight binding, approximation for solids is discussed as an interpolation method, to be used in connection with more accurate calculations made by the cellular or orthogonalized plane-wave methods. It is proposed that the various integrals be obtained as disposable constants, so that the tight binding method will agree with accurate calculations at symmetry points in the Brillouin zone for which these calculations have been made, and that the LCAO method then be used for making calculations throughout the Brillouin zone. A general discussion of the method is given, including tables of matrix components of energy for simple cubic, face-centered and body-centered cubic, and diamond structures. Applications are given to the results of Fletcher and Wohlfarth on Ni, and Howarth on Cu, as illustrations of the fcc case. In discussing the bcc case, the splitting of the energy bands in chromium by an antiferromagnetic alternating potential is worked out, as well as a distribution of energy states for the case of no antiferromagnetism. For diamond, comparisons are made with the calculations of Herman, using the orthogonalized plane-wave method. The case of such crystals as InSb is discussed, and it is shown that their properties fit in with the energy band picture. {\textcopyright} 1954 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of nitrogen and boron doping on Li diffusion through defected graphene using first principles based density functional theory. While a high energy barrier rules out the possibility of Li- diffusion through the pristine graphene, the barrier reduces with the incorporation of defects. Among the most common defects in pristine graphene, Li diffusion through the divacancy encounters the lowest energy barrier of 1.34 eV. The effect of nitrogen and boron doping on the Li diffusion through doped defected-graphene sheets has been studied. N-doping in graphene with a monovacancy reduces the energy barrier significantly. The barrier reduces with the increasing number of N atoms. On the other hand, for N doped graphene with a divacancy, Li binds in the plane of the sheet, with an enhanced binding energy. The B doping in graphene with a monovacancy leads to the enhancement of the barrier. However, in the case of B-doped graphene with a divacancy, the barrier reduces to 1.54 eV, which could lead to good kinetics. The barriers do not change significantly with B concentration. Therefore, divacancy, B and N doped defected graphene has emerged as a better alternative to pristine graphene as an anode material for Li ion battery.},

abstract = {Emerging contaminants (ECs) such as bisphenol A (BPA), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) have gained immense attention worldwide due to their potential threat to humans and environment. Graphene oxide (GO) nanomaterial is considered as an important sorbent due to its exceptional range of environmental application owing to its unique properties. GO was also considered as one of ECs because of its potential hazard. The adsorption of organic contaminants such as phenolic ECs on GO affects the stability of GO nanoflakes in water and the fate of organic contaminants, which would cause further environmental risk. Therefore, the adsorption behaviors of emerging and common phenolic compounds (PCs) including phenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 4-NP, BPA and TBBPA on GO nanoflakes and their stability in water were studied. The adsorption equilibrium for all the compounds was reached <10 h and was fitted with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. In addition to hydrophobic effect, adsorption mechanisms included $\pi$-$\pi$ bonding and hydrogen bonding interactions between the adsorbate and GO, especially the electrostatic interactions were observed. Phenol has the highest adsorption affinity due to the formation of hydrogen bond. GO has a good stability in water even after the adsorption of PCs in the presence of a common electrolyte, which could affect its transport with organic contaminants in the environment. These better understandings illustrate the mechanism of emerging and common PC interaction with GO nanoflakes and facilitate the prediction of the contaminant fate in the aquatic environment.},

All sorption isotherms were fitted well with Freundlich model and the binding capability followed an order of HA-5 > HA-2 > BSA > pepsin > lysozyme. In NaCl solution, phenanthrene binding to HA-BSA complexes was much higher than the sum of binding to individual HA and BSA, while there was no enhancement for HA-pepsin. Positively charged lysozyme slightly lowered phenanthrene binding on both HAs due to strong aggregation of HA-lysozyme complexes, leading to reduction in the number of binding sites. The binding enhancement by HA-BSA was observed under all tested ion species and ionic strengths. This enhancement can be explained by unfolding of protein, reduction of aggregate size and formation of HA-BSA complexes with favorable conformations for binding phenanthrene. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A computational method for partitioning a charge density grid into Bader volumes is presented which is efficient, robust, and scales linearly with the number of grid points. The partitioning algorithm follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {We describe an ab initio method for calculating the electronic structure, electronic transport, and forces acting on the atoms, for atomic scale systems connected to semi-infinite electrodes and with an applied voltage bias. Our method is based on the density-functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the well tested SIESTA approach (which uses nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials to describe the effect of the core electrons, and linear combination of finite-range numerical atomic orbitals to describe the valence states). We fully deal with the atomistic structure of the whole system, treating both the contact and the electrodes on the same footing. The effect of the finite bias (including self-consistency and the solution of the electrostatic problem) is taken into account using nonequilibrium Greens functions. We relate the nonequilibrium Greens function expressions to the more transparent scheme involving the scattering states. As an illustration, the method is applied to three systems where we are able to compare our results to earlier ab initio DFT calculations or experiments, and we point out differences between this method and existing schemes. The systems considered are: (i) single atom carbon wires connected to aluminum electrodes with extended or finite cross section, (ii) single atom gold wires, and finally (iii) large carbon nanotube systems with point defects.},

@article{Gritsenko2004,
abstract = {Spin-unrestricted Kohn-Sham (KS) solutions are constructed from accurate ab initio spin densities for the prototype doublet molecules NO(2), ClO(2), and NF(2) with the iterative local updating procedure of van Leeuwen and Baerends (LB). A qualitative justification of the LB procedure is given with a "strong" form of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. The calculated energies epsilon(isigma) of the occupied KS spin orbitals provide numerical support to the analogue of Koopmans' theorem in spin-density functional theory. In particular, the energies -epsilon(ibeta) of the minor spin (beta) valence orbitals of the considered doublet molecules correspond fairly well to the experimental vertical ionization potentials (VIPs) I(i) (1) to the triplet cationic states. The energy -epsilon(Halpha) of the highest occupied (spin-unpaired) alpha orbital is equal to the first VIP I(H) (0) to the singlet cationic state. In turn, the energies -epsilon(ialpha) of the major spin (alpha) valence orbitals of the closed subshells correspond to a fifty-fifty average of the experimental VIPs I(i) (1) and I(i) (0) to the triplet and singlet states. For the Li atom we find that the exact spin densities are represented by a spin-polarized Kohn-Sham system which is not in its ground state, i.e., the orbital energy of the lowest unoccupied beta spin orbital is lower than that of the highest occupied alpha spin orbital ("a hole below the Fermi level"). The addition of a magnetic field in the -z direction will shift the beta levels up so as to restore the Aufbau principle. This is an example of the nonuniqueness of the mapping of the spin density on the KS spin-dependent potentials discussed recently in the literature. The KS potentials may no longer go to zero at infinity, and it is in general the differences nu(ssigma)( infinity )-epsilon(isigma) that can be interpreted as (averages of) ionization energies. In total, the present results suggest the spin-unrestricted KS theory as a natural one-electron independent-particle model for interpretation and assignment of the experimental photoelectron spectra of open-shell molecules.},

abstract = {Structural evolution and stability pattern of pure neutral gold clusters Aun in the small size range of n = 20-30 are examined using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The equilibrium geometries are either confirmed or determined, and some new ground state structures are identified. The most stable configurations of Au21-Au23 sizes are formed by adding extra gold atoms to the highly stable pyramidal structure of Au20, while flat-cage shapes are the best candidates for the global minima of both Au24 and Au25. For larger sizes of n = 26-30, pyramidal motifs tend to dominate the lower-lying population rather than tubular conformations as previously reported. The energy gaps, excitation energies, and exciton binding energies are also computed to test out the performance of the computational methods employed. Accordingly, a density functional with long-range exchange effects is highly recommended to quantitatively investigate both the ground and excited states of pure gold clusters.},

abstract = {The innovation on the low dimensional nanomaterials brings the rapid growth of nano community. Developing the controllable production and commercial applications of nanomaterials for sustainable society is highly concerned. Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with sp(2) carbon bonding, excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal, as well as transport properties are selected as model nanomaterials to demonstrate the road of nanomaterials towards industry. The engineering principles of the mass production and recent progress in the area of CNT purification and dispersion are described, as well as its bulk application for nanocomposites and energy storage. The environmental, health, and safety considerations of CNTs, and recent progress in CNT commercialization are also included. With the effort from the CNT industry during the past 10 years, the price of multi-walled CNTs have decreased from 45 000 to 100 $ kg(-1) and the productivity increased to several hundred tons per year for commercial applications in Li ion battery and nanocomposites. When the prices of CNTs decrease to 10 $ kg(-1) , their applications as composites and conductive fillers at a million ton scale can be anticipated, replacing conventional carbon black fillers. Compared with traditional bulk chemicals, the controllable synthesis and applications of CNTs on a million ton scale are still far from being achieved due to the challenges in production, purification, dispersion, and commercial application. The basic knowledge of growth mechanisms, efficient and controllable routes for CNT production, the environmental and safety issues, and the commercialization models are still inadequate. The gap between the basic scientific research and industrial development should be bridged by multidisciplinary research for the rapid growth of CNT nano-industry.},

abstract = {Density functional calculations have been used to investigate the effect of the N doping on the electronic and magnetic properties of finite-size and open-ended zigzag carbon nanotubes (CNT). The carbon atoms at the edge site are more easily replaced by N atoms energetically, compared to other sites. The single N atom substitution can reduce the magnetic moment of edge carbon atoms near the doping site and result in the suppression of spin polarization. Such spin suppression is independent of tube diameter and it can be ascribed into perturbation of the p/p state localized at the doped edge. At low N-doping concentrations, the finite-length zigzag CNTs can maintain an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state, but the conversion from AFM to a nonmagnetic state can occur at high impurity concentrations. More interestingly, the tunable electronic properties from the half-semiconducting to semiconducting state can be realized in these N-doped finite-size and open-ended CNTs if subjected to a variably external electric field along the tube axis.},

abstract = {$\sigma$-Holes are regions of positive molecular electrostatic potential collinear with and opposite to covalent bonds to atoms of Groups IV-VII. They are responsible for many noncovalent bonding interactions, such as halogen bonding. $\sigma$-Holes make 'negatively charged' atoms act as if they were 'positively charged'. The existence of $\sigma$-hole bonding emphasizes what has been called 'the fallacy of net atomic charges', which means that many covalently bonded atoms cannot be represented adequately by a single charge because they look negative from some directions and positive from others. Hydrogen bonding can also be regarded as a special case of $\sigma$-hole bonding, although in this case the origin of the $\sigma$-hole is rationalized differently than in the heavier elements. Phenomena such as the directionality of hydrogen bonds and 'blue-shifted' hydrogen bonds can be explained very simply using the $\sigma$-hole concept. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This review will focus on the development of nanoscale drug delivery mechanisms. Nanostructured drug carriers allow for the delivery of not only small-molecule drugs but also the delivery of nucleic acids and proteins. Delivery of these molecules to specific areas within the body can be achieved, which will reduce systemic side effects and allow for more efficient use of the drug. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A reformulation and extension of the previous theory is described. The new formulation has the advantage of being conceptually simpler than the earlier theory; it can, in fact, be developed in close analogy with the usual theory of spin waves. It is shown that the simplest approximations in the new formulation lead to theories of the crystal field, the Weiss molecular field, spin waves, polarization waves and the quasi-electron theory of the earlier papers of this series. The new formulation permits one to take into account the interactions of electrons on different atoms and to consider solutions of the anti-ferromagnetic and more complicated kinds. The theory is developed by the ‘equation of motion' method.},

@article{Shahbazian2018,
abstract = {Equating (3,−1) critical points (CPs), derived from the topological analysis of the electron densities, to chemical bonds has triggered a lot of confusion in recent years. Part of this confusion stems from calling these CPs “bond” CPs (BCPs). While the origin of this terminology is traceable to the late seventies and beginning of eighties, when it sounded reasonable, new computational studies conducted on molecular electron densities cast serious doubt on the supposed universal equivalence between the chemical bonds and (3,−1) CPs. Herein, recent computational studies are briefly reviewed to demonstrate why (3,−1) CPs are not indicators of chemical bonds. It is discussed why this confusing terminology needs to be changed and reemphasized that (3,−1) CPs should be called “line” critical points (LCPs). The proposed terminology detaches the topological properties of molecular electron densities from any a priori chemical interpretation. Such detachment, if adopted by other authors, will hopefully prevent further misinterpretation of the data emerging from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM).},

These interactions between halide anion and carbon in methyl group can be categorized as the typical tetrel bonds. Statistics of geometrical parameters for such tetrel bonds in CSD is analyzed. It is established that the binding energy in molecular complexes with tetrel bonds correlate with the potential acting on an electron in molecule (PAEM). The PAEM barriers for tetrel bonds show a similar behavior for both sets of complexes with Br− and Cl− electron donors.},

The possibility of achieving both acceptor and donor doping and precise changes of the SWCNT doping level by the filling of channels and transformation of incorporated substances was demonstrated. This article presents a comprehensive review of the current status of the research on the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs. The review begins with a brief description of basic aspects of the band theory of solids and peculiarities of the band structure and electronic properties of SWCNTs. The next part of the review is dedicated to a systematization and description of different methods for modification of the SWCNT electronic properties. Then, the review introduces filling methods of SWCNT inner channels. The main part of the review is dedicated to an analysis, systematization and generalization of the up-to-date reported results on experimental and theoretical investigations of the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs and nanostructures obtained as result of chemical reactions inside the SWCNT channels. Finally, the possible applications of filled nanotubes are highlighted.},

abstract = {Nickel matrix composites are important materials for various engineering applications. The present paper describes the fabrication of bulk graphene-nickel (Gr-Ni) and reduced graphene oxide-nickel (rGO-Ni) composites by powder metallurgy technique using various graphene sources, namely, thermally exfoliated graphite (TEFG) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the investigation of the mechanical properties of the composites. Homogeneous distribution of graphene derivatives in the composite matrices was confirmed for all compositions by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. It was proved that different Gr sources in the initial powder mixtures result in some different graphene derivatives type in the composites produced. Nevertheless, scanning electron microscopy data demonstrated that the microstructure of the samples produced using the different graphene sources is rather similar. It was shown that the mechanical properties of the composites are very sensitive to the type of graphene derivative chosen at low additive contents. TEFG addition results in the decreased values of tensile strength, ductility, and elongation for all compositions. It was shown that 0.1 wt.% of rGO addition resulted in the 34 % elongation-to-failure increase with no change in the UTS value of composite. The 0.1 wt.% rGO-Ni composite showed the increased elongation and the tensile strength value comparable to pure nickel specimen. Fractography tests revealed the difference in the mechanical behaviour of rGO-Ni and Gr-Ni composites.},

abstract = {Fluorescence has been observed directly across the band gap of semiconducting carbon nanotubes. We obtained individual nanotubes, each encased in a cylindrical micelle, by ultrasonically agitating an aqueous dispersion of raw single-walled carbon nanotubes in sodium dodecyl sulfate and then centrifuging to remove tube bundles, ropes, and residual catalyst. Aggregation of nanotubes into bundles otherwise quenches the fluorescence through interactions with metallic tubes and substantially broadens the absorption spectra. At pH less than 5, the absorption and emission spectra of individual nanotubes show evidence of band gap-selective protonation of the side walls of the tube. This protonation is readily reversed by treatment with base or ultraviolet light.},

Two graphitic precursors (graphite flakes and graphite powder) were tested to synthesize graphene-related materials using mechanochemical treatment. For comparison, chemical graphite oxide (GO imp) was synthesized. The pristine and final products were characterized by SEM-EDX, particle size distribution, elemental analysis, surface area, DTA-TG and Raman spectra. Oxygen/carbon ratios of the mechanochemical and chemical routes were detected by EDX and confirmed using elemental analysis. The surface area increased from $\sim$1 up to 666 and 328 m2 g−1 for graphite flakes and graphite powder at 24 h of mechanochemical treatment, respectively. However, the surface area for GO imp reached 157 m2 g−1. The removal of methylene blue, acid orange 7 and bisphenol A with the mechanochemical synthesized graphite oxides reached >93.8% at 30 min. The adsorption mechanism is mainly governed by $\pi$ − $\pi$ interactions and hydrogen bonding.},

abstract = {Real time imaging experiments with metal nanowires (NWs), in particular gold under stress, that show their formation, evolution, and breaking, were obtained with high resolution electron microscopy. In order to understand these results, we use density functional theory (DFT) based methods to simulate the evolution of Au NWs. First we use a tight-binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) method to understand the mechanisms of formation of very thin gold NWs. We present realistic simulations for the breaking of these NWs, whose main features are very similar to the experimental results. We show how defects lead to the formation of one-atom constrictions in the Au NW, which evolves into a one-atom-thick necklace chain. Similarly to the experimental results, we obtain that these necklaces can get as long as five-atoms from apex to apex. Before breaking, we obtain relatively large Au-Au bond distances, of the order of 3.0-3.1 {\AA}. A further pull of the wire causes a sudden increase of one of the bond distances, indicating the breaking of the NW. To get some more insight into the electronic structure aspects of this problem, we considered several of our tight-binding structures before breaking and studied them in detail using an ab initio method based on the DFT. By pulling the wire quasi-statically in this case, we also observed the breaking of the wire at similar distances as in the TBMD. This result was independent of the exchange-correlation potential used-either the local density approximation (LDA) or the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The pulling force before rupture was obtained as 2.4 nN for the LDA, and 1.9 nN for the GGA. Finally, we also present a detailed analysis of the electronic structure properties for the Au neck atoms, such as the density of states and charge densities, for some configurations before the rupture. {\textcopyright} 2004 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We compare popular analytical techniques, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Raman and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, for the evaluation of the purity of bulk quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Despite their importance as imaging techniques, SEM and TEM are not capable of quantitatively evaluating the purity of typical inhomogeneous bulk SWNT samples because the image frame visualizes less than 1 pg of SWNT material; furthermore, there is no published algorithm to convert such images into numerical data. The TGA technique is capable of measuring the amount of metal catalyst in an SWNT sample, but does not provide an unambiguous separation between the content of SWNTs and carbonaceous impurities. We discuss the utilization of solution-phase near-infrared spectroscopy and solution-phase Raman spectroscopy to quantitatively compare arbitrary samples of bulk SWNT materials of different purities. The primary goal of this paper is to provide the chemical community with a realistic evaluation of current analytical tools for the purity evaluation of a bulk sample of SWNTs. The secondary goal is to draw attention to the growing crisis in the SWNT industry as a result of the lack of quality control and the misleading advertising by suppliers of this material.},

abstract = {The interactions between a pair of Li+ ions across a semiconducting (8,0)CNT and a conducting (5,5)CNT has been investigated by density functional theory. The direct Coulomb interaction between the ions is almost completely screened. The band structure of the CNTs is not affected by the Li+ ions, but the Fermi level is raised to accommodate the extra electrons. Because of the unique band structure of CNTs this results in an effective attraction between the ions, which is greater for the (8,0)CNT. In contrast, a Cl- ion inside a CNT forms a chemical bond which modifies the band structure. Again, the electrostatic field of the ion is almost completely screened outside of the tube. Nevertheless, the adsorption of a Li+ ion outside is favored by a Cl- ion inside. This apparent attraction is mainly caused by a lowering of the work function of the CNT by the presence of the Cl-},

abstract = {We develop a nonempirical atoms-in-molecules (AIM) method for computing net atomic charges that simultaneously reproduce chemical states of atoms in a material and the electrostatic potential V(r) outside its electron distribution. This method gives accurate results for a variety of periodic and nonperiodic materials including molecular systems, solid surfaces, porous solids, and nonporous solids. This method, called DDEC/c3, improves upon our previously published DDEC/c2 method (Manz, T. A.; Sholl, D. S. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010, 6, 2455-2468) by accurately treating nonporous solids with short bond lengths. Starting with the theory all AIM charge partitioning functionals with spherically symmetric atomic weights must satisfy, the form of the DDEC/c3 functional is derived from first principles. The method is designed to converge robustly by avoiding conditions that lead to nearly flat optimization landscapes. In addition to net atomic charges, the method can also compute atomic multipoles and atomic spin moments. Calculations performed on a variety of systems demonstrate the method's accuracy, computational efficiency, and good agreement with available experimental data. Comparisons to a variety of other charge assignment methods (Bader, natural population analysis, electrostatic potential fitting, Hirshfeld, iterative Hirshfeld, and iterative stockholder atoms) show that the DDEC/c3 net atomic charges are well-suited for constructing flexible force-fields for atomistic simulations. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {First principles calculations using density functional theory were carried out to obtain the geometrical properties and the radial breathing mode (RBM) frequency of 40 different single-walled carbon nanotubes with small diameter. Fourteen chiral nanotubes with diameters less than 0.8¬†nm were considered, for which the number of atoms in the unit cell is not larger than 200. From the achiral (zigzag, armchair) nanotubes all those having a diameter less than 1.6¬†nm were considered. The geometrical parameters deviate from the values obtained from simple wrapping of a perfect hexagonal sheet. The deviation from the ideal behaviour increases with increasing curvature. The most prominent change is the increase of the diameter with respect to its ideal value. The lattice constant along the tube axis exhibits a slight shrinking. The RBM frequency does not follow the usually assumed 1/ d behaviour; there is a general softening with increasing curvature. The softening of the RBM frequency cannot be described by a simple function of the diameter; it also depends on the chiral angle and the metallicity of the tube. In addition to this, the coupling of the totally symmetric radial motion with the totally symmetric tangential motion(s) has a non-negligible effect.},

abstract = {We report a new method for the purification of HiPCO single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT), which consists of the following sequence: (a) organic functionalization of the as-produced nanotubes (pristine tubes, p-SWNT), (b) purification of the soluble functionalized nanotubes (f-SWNT), (c) removal of the functional groups and recovery of purified nanotubes (r-SWNT) by thermal treatment at 350 degrees C, followed by annealing to 900 degrees C. Each of these steps contributes to the purification, but only their sequential combination leads to high-purity materials. Organic functionalization makes the SWNT more easy to handle, which results in a better manipulation for potential practical uses. The electronic properties of the purified tubes are investigated via Raman and NIR spectroscopies along with transmission electron microscopy.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Li adsorption on a graphene-C-60 nanobud system using density functional theory. Li adsorption on the hybrid system was enhanced compared to those using pure graphene and C-60. The Li adsorption energies ranged from -1.784 to -2.346 eV for the adsorption of a single Li atom, and from -1.905 to -2.229 eV for the adsorption of two Li atoms. Furthermore, adsorption energies were similar at most positions throughout the structure. The Li adsorption energy of an 18-Li adsorbed system was calculated to be -1.684 eV, which is significantly lower than Li-Li binding energy (-1.030 eV). These results suggest that Li atoms will be adsorbed preferentially (1) between C-60 and C-60, (2) between graphene and C-60, (3) on graphene, or (4) on C-60, rather than form Li clusters. As more Li atoms were adsorbed onto the graphene-C-60 nanobud system because of its improved Li adsorption capability, the metallic character of the system was enhanced, which was confirmed via analysis of band structure and electronic density of states.},

Their mechanical properties have so far eluded direct measurement, however, because of the very small dimensions of nanotubes. Here we estimate the Young's modulus of isolated nanotubes by measuring, in the transmission electron microscope, the amplitude of their intrinsic thermal vibrations. We find that carbon nanotubes have exceptionally high Young's moduli, in the terapascal (TPa) range. Their high stiffness, coupled with their low density, implies that nanotubes might be useful as nanoscale fibres in strong, lightweight composite materials.},

abstract = {Is the plasmon description within the nonlocal correlation of the van der Waals density functional by Dion and coworkers (vdW-DF) robust enough to describe all exchange-correlation components? To address this question, we design an exchange functional based on this plasmon description as well as recent analysis on exchange in the large-s regime. In the regime with reduced gradients s=|;n|/2nkF(n) smaller than ≈2.5, dominating the nonlocal correlation part of the binding energy, the enhancement factor Fx(s) closely resembles the Langreth-Vosko screened exchange. In the s regime beyond, dominated by exchange, Fx(s) passes smoothly over to the revised Perdew-Wang-86 form. We term the specific exchange functional LV-PW86r, wheras the full van der Waals functional version emphasizing consistent handling of exchange is termed vdW-DF-cx. Our tests indicate that vdW-DF-cx produces accurate separations and binding energies of the S22 data set of molecular dimers as well as accurate lattice constants and bulk moduli of layered materials and tightly bound solids. These results suggest that the plasmon description within vdW-DF gives a good description of both exchange and correlation effects in the low-to-moderate s regime. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Contrary to a wide-spread belief that alkali metal (AM) atoms intercalated into layered materials form single-layer structures only, recent experiments [Nature 564 (2018) 234] showed that multi-layer configurations of lithium are possible in bi-layer graphene. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we systematically study the intercalation energetics for various AMs (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) in bi-layer graphene and MoS2. We demonstrate that for bi-layer graphene as host the formation energy of multi-layer structures is negative for K, Rb and Cs and only slightly positive for both Li and Na. In view of the previous experimental data on lithium, a multi-layer of Na might therefore form, while it is well-known that single-layers of Na in graphitic hosts are energetically very unfavorable. In MoS2, multi-layer structures are considerably higher in energy than the single-layer ones, but the formation of the former can still occur, especially for the AMs with the lowest electro-negativity. To rationalize the results, we assess the charge transfer from the intercalants to the host material and analyze the interplay between the ionic and covalent bonding of AM and host atoms. While our theoretical effort primarily focuses on the fundamental aspects of AM intercalation, our findings may stimulate experimental work addressing multi-layer intercalation to maximize the capacity of anode materials in AM ion batteries.},

However, the contradictory data on the toxic effects of single-walled carbon nanotubes highlight the need for alternative ways to study their uptake and cytotoxic effects in cells. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have been shown to be acutely toxic in a number of types of cells, but the direct observation of cellular uptake of single-walled carbon nanotubes has not been demonstrated previously due to difficulties in discriminating carbon-based nanotubes from carbon-rich cell structures. Here we use transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to image the translocation of single-walled carbon nanotubes into cells in both stained and unstained human cells. The nanotubes were seen to enter the cytoplasm and localize within the cell nucleus, causing cell mortality in a dose-dependent manner.},

The obtained optimized geometries reveal that Li atoms insertion dramatically modifies the nanotube structures. Averaged binding energies, fragmentation energies, second-order energy differences, and Mulliken population analysis are expressed as Li concentration functions. Results reveal Fermi level displacement towards the conduction band due to the Li atoms' charge transfer to the nanotube walls. Stability analysis identifies the complexes with superior relative stability. In particular, nanotubes (7.7) and (8.8) show storage capacities that exceed the graphite's intercalation limit.},

As a result, it was found that surface fluorine contents were varied with changing an oxyfluorination temperature and showed a maximum value at 100 degrees C. By changing the treatment temperature in the process of oxyfluorination for carbon supports, the surface characteristics of MWNTs had been modified, resulting that the size and loading content of deposited Pt on the modified carbon supports could be changed. Consequently, Pt deposited MWNTs that were treated at 100 degrees C (Pt/100-MWNTs) showed the best electroactivity among samples. The enhanced electroactivity was dependent on the higher surface area of electrochemical reaction for metal catalyst, which was related to the particle size and the morphology of the deposited particle catalysts.},

The comparison of the effects of various experimental parameters on the structure of fluorinated materials allows the disclosure of the fluorination mechanism. It is shown that fluorine was intercalated into the outer part of the carbon nanotubes initially where graphene layers were coaxial within a distance of 0.60 nm. In contrast, the inner part of the carbon nanotubes was not intercalated. The electrochemical performance such as discharge capacity as a cathode for a primary lithium battery has also been investigated. The samples with a F/C ratio of 0.75 exhibited the best performance, namely high energy and power densities.

abstract = {Free-standing paper-like or foil-like materials are an integral part of our technological society. Their uses include protective layers, chemical filters, components of electrical batteries or supercapacitors, adhesive layers, electronic or optoelectronic components, and molecular storage. Inorganic 'paper-like' materials based on nanoscale components such as exfoliated vermiculite or mica platelets have been intensively studied and commercialized as protective coatings, high-temperature binders, dielectric barriers and gas-impermeable membranes4,5. Carbon-based flexible graphite foils composed of stacked platelets of expanded graphite have long been used in packing and gasketing applications because of their chemical resistivity against most media, superior sealability over a wide temperature range, and impermeability to fluids. The discovery of carbon nanotubes brought about bucky paper, which displays excellent mechanical and electrical properties that make it potentially suitable for fuel cell and structural composite applications. Here we report the preparation and characterization of graphene oxide paper, a free-standing carbon-based membrane material made by flow-directed assembly of individual graphene oxide sheets. This new material outperforms many other paper-like materials in stiffness and strength. Its combination of macroscopic flexibility and stiffness is a result of a unique interlocking-tile arrangement of the nanoscale graphene oxide sheets. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Molecular structure does not easily identify the intricate noncovalent interactions that govern many areas of biology and chemistry, including design of new materials and drugs. We develop an approach to detect noncovalent interactions in real space, based on the electron density and its derivatives. Our approach reveals the underlying chemistry that compliments the covalent structure. It provides a rich representation of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and steric repulsion in small molecules, molecular complexes, and solids. Most importantly, the method, requiring only knowledge of the atomic coordinates, is efficient and applicable to large systems, such as proteins or DNA. Across these applications, a view of nonbonded interactions emerges as continuous surfaces rather than close contacts between atom pairs, offering rich insight into the design of new and improved ligands. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A coupled cluster expansion was used to direct an ab initio search for stable ordered structures on the cubic fluorite lattice across the ZrO2-Y2O3 composition range. The energies of 453 arrangements of (Zr, Y) cations and (O, vacancy) anions on the fluorite lattice were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation. These DFT energies were used to construct a coupled cluster expansion that allowed the search for possible T=0 K ground-state structures through similar to 10(5) cation/anion configurations. Our approach correctly identifies the experimentally observed compound Zr3Y4O12 and also predicts an as-yet-unobserved ordered structure with Zr4Y2O11 stoichiometry. In the latter structure, vacancies are at second nearest neighbors from yttrium and every Zr has seven oxygen first nearest neighbors. The Zr-O bond lengths and oxygen coordination around Zr in the Zr4Y2O11 ground state are nearly the same as those in monoclinic ZrO2. We also predict structures at Zr5Y2O13 and Zr6Y2O15 that are stable with respect to cubic ZrO2 but metastable with respect to monoclinic ZrO2.},

The extinction peaks of these gold nanoshells were considerably redshifted as compared to solid gold colloids having approximately the same dimensions. In addition, the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoshells exhibited a much more sensitive response toward environmental changes even when compared with solid colloids with a mean size much smaller than that of gold nanoshells.},

abstract = {We performed low temperature photoluminescence (PL) studies on individual oxygen-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and correlated our observations to electronic structure simulations. Our experiment reveals multiple sharp asymmetric emission peaks at energies 50-300 meV red-shifted from that of the E11 bright exciton peak. Our simulation suggests an association of these peaks with deep trap states tied to different specific chemical adducts. In addition, oxygen doping is also observed to split the E11 exciton into two or more states with an energy splitting <40 meV. We attribute these states to dark states that are brightened through defect-induced symmetry breaking. While the wave functions of these brightened states are delocalized, those of the deep-trap states are strongly localized and pinned to the dopants. These findings are consistent with our experimental observation of asymmetric broadening of the deep trap emission peaks, which can result from interaction between pinned excitons and one-dimensional phonons. Exciton pinning also increases the sensitivity of the deep traps to the local dielectric environment, leading to a large inhomogeneous broadening. Observations of multiple spectral features on single nanotubes indicate the possibility of different chemical adducts coexisting on a given nanotube.},

Here, we explored the application of novel carbonaceous LIB anodes incorporating graphene quantum dots (GQDs). We fabricated a freestanding all-carbon electrode based on a porous carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge via a facile in-situ hydrothermal deposition technique, creating coaxial structure of GQD-coated CNTs (GQD@CNTs) through electrostatic interaction and $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking with tunable loading and functionalization. This hybrid structure combined conductive CNTs with highly active GQDs, in which GQDs with predesigned functional groups provided massive storage sites for Li ions and the 3D CNT frameworks avoided the agglomeration of GQDs, together contributing to a high specific capacity (700 mAh}g−1 at 100 mA}g−1 after 100 cycles) and rate performance. Even at a high current density of 1,000 mA}g−1, the reversible specific capacity remained at 483 mAh}g−1 after 350 cycles. In particular, the mechanism study demonstrated the important role of oxygen functional groups of GQDs in promoting the performance of the LIB anodes by controlled grafting of GQDs onto various porous-carbon and metal-foam based structures.

The Dirac electrons behave in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and the integer quantum Hall effect. The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons. Different types of disorder modify the Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic and transport properties.

According to the Langmuir model, the maximum sorption capacity of BPA by the fullerene C60 in the studied systems was of 74.44 mg/g, at 20 0C, being observed that it varies by the temperature. The kinetic data were better described by the intra-particle diffusion model in the optimum range of pH values between 7 and 9.},

abstract = {Digital twins are emerging as powerful tools for supporting innovation as well as optimizing the in-service performance of a broad range of complex physical machines, devices, and components. A digital twin is generally designed to provide accurate in-silico representation of the form (i.e., appearance) and the functional response of a specified (unique) physical twin. This paper offers a new perspective on how the emerging concept of digital twins could be applied to accelerate materials innovation efforts. Specifically, it is argued that the material itself can be considered as a highly complex multiscale physical system whose form (i.e., details of the material structure over a hierarchy of material length) and function (i.e., response to external stimuli typically characterized through suitably defined material properties) can be captured suitably in a digital twin. Accordingly, the digital twin can represent the evolution of structure, process, and performance of the material over time, with regard to both process history and in-service environment. This paper establishes the foundational concepts and frameworks needed to formulate and continuously update both the form and function of the digital twin of a selected material physical twin. The form of the proposed material digital twin can be captured effectively using the broadly applicable framework of n-point spatial correlations, while its function at the different length scales can be captured using homogenization and localization process-structure-property surrogate models calibrated to collections of available experimental and physics-based simulation data.},

The spin-orbit interaction can be included as a perturbation once the 'relativistic' spin-polarised bands and wavefunctions have been obtained. The technique is used together with the local spin density approximation for exchange and correlation to calculate the self-consistent charge and spin density of a neutral Gd atom. The calculated magnetic form factor agrees extremely well with experiment. Comparison with a paramagnetic RAPW calculation shows the procedure should be accurate and fast for general band structure determinations.},

In this paper, we review the main results obtained by the approach regarding the intrinsic features of the phonons of single-walled (SWNT) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT). First, we detail the different methods to identify the structure of SWNTs and DWNTs from the analysis of their electron diffraction patterns (EDP). In the following, we remind the principal features of the Raman response of SWNTs, unambiguously index-identified by ED. A special attention is devoted to the effect of the inter-layer interaction on the frequencies of the Raman-active phonons in index-identified DWNTs. The information obtained on index-identified SWNT and DWNT allows us to propose Raman criteria, which help identifying CNT when the ED fails to propose a single assignment. The efficiency of the Raman criteria as the complement to the ED information for the index-assignment of a few SWNTs and DWNTs is shown. The same approach to index-assign a triple-walled carbon nanotube (TWNT), by combining ED and RRS information, is reported.},

abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchangecorrelation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density, It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

abstract = {Lithium (Li) metal is promising in the next-generation energy storage systems. However, its practical application is still hindered by the poor cycling performance and serious safety issues for the consequence of dendritic Li. Herein, a dendrite-free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid is proposed, which is fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs, for Li-metal batteries. The favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are the powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network, which is the key to form a uniform metallic layer in Li/CNTs hybrid. The obtained hybrid indicates super-stable functions even at an ultrahigh current density of 40 mA cm−2 for 2000 cycles with a stripping/plating capacity of 2 mAh cm−2 in symmetric cells. Subsequently, this hybrid also demonstrates a significantly decreased resistance, excellent cycling stability at high current density and flexibility in the full Li-S battery. This work provides valuable concepts in fabricating Li anodes toward Li-metal batteries and beyond for their high-level services.},

Extending the spectral ranges of absorption and PL measurements beyond 2300 nm made it possible to detect signals both from the inner and the outer shells of DWNTs. Application of in situ perturbations, namely, oxidation with light-generated ozone and electrochemical doping, unambiguously proved the double-wall structure of our samples and revealed the efficient shielding of the inner DWNT shells by the outer shells. Analysis of the absorption spectra measured under progressive ozone oxidation allowed us to decompose the total DWNT absorption into the contributions from the inner and outer shells and to estimate the filling ratio of DWNTs.},

Atom atom non-bonded potential energy and semiempirical quantum chemical calculations have been performed. The xanthene rings of 1 to 3 are slightly bent and the phthalide rings are planar. The phthalide ring moieties are almost perpendicular (88.9(1) 93.5(5)°) to the xanthene rings. The bond lengths C(6) O(2) are apparently extended from the normal C(sp3) O(lactone) length. The temperature factors for one butyl group C(32) C(35)) of 1 increase gradually toward the terminal carbon. The temperature factors for C(30) C(33) of 2 indicate large vibrations and these are reflected in short bond lengths. Two butyl groups of 3 are disordered and these C C bond lengths are short and long alternately. Atomic net charges around spirocarbon C(6) and toward N(1) to C(6) indicate the weak alternative system in the colorless form. As the xanthene ring has a planar geometry, the $\pi$ electron density migration will easily occur from the auxochromes attached to the phthalide ring to the xanthene ring.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional gold nanoelectrode ensembles (3D GNE) have proven to be promising nanoelectrodes by representing much higher sensitivity compared to both their 2D nanostructures and bulk counterparts. The sensitivity of 3D gold nanotubes (GNTs) fabricated through electrodeposition inside the pores of polycarbonate templates, was examined toward metronidazole (MTZ) as one of their pharmaceutical applications. The electrochemical behavior of MTZ at the 3D GNT-modified electrode was discussed in detail through cyclic voltammetry (CV) which suggested an irreversible reduction of nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine and a subsequently reversible redox peak for the corresponding product. This latter redox peak was selected for MTZ determination which has not been reported, so far. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) was used as a powerful tool for detection of MTZ in different concentrations. Under the optimal conditions, the highly sensitive 3D GNT showed a wide linear range from 1 nM to 2 $\mu$M with a sufficiently low detection limit of 0.1 nM demonstrating promising results for the future usage in clinical applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent experiments have indicated that dopants and defects can trigger new redshifted photoluminescence (PL) peaks below the E-11 peak in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). To understand the origin of the new PL peaks, we study theoretically the excited-state properties of SWCNTs with some typical dopants and defects by ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Our calculations demonstrate that the Stokes shift in doped centers can be as large as 170 meV, which is much larger than that of intact SWCNTs and must be taken into account. We find dipole-allowed transitions from localized midgap and shallow impurity levels, which can give rise to pronounced PL peaks. Dark excitons, on the other hand, seem to have oscillator strengths that are too small to account for the new PL peaks.},

We confirm that it is impossible to determine unambiguously the nature of its E33 optical transition (excitonic vs band to band) based only on the excitation profiles. Nevertheless, by combining Raman scattering, Rayleigh scattering, and optical absorption measurements on strictly the same individual (23,7) single-walled carbon nanotube, we show that the absorption, Rayleigh spectra, and Raman excitation profiles of the longitudinal and transverseGmodes are best fitted by considering the nature of the E33 transition as excitonic. The fit of the three sets of data gives close values of the transition energyE33 and damping parameter ?33. This comparison shows that the fit of the Raman excitation profiles provides with good accuracy the energy and damping parameter of the excitonic optical transitions in single-walled carbon nanotubes},

abstract = {We study the optical and electrical properties of transparent conducting films made from length-sorted single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Thin films of length-sorted SWCNTs, formed through filtration from a dispersing solvent onto a filter substrate ("buckypaper"), exhibit sharp changes in their optical properties and conductivity (sigma) with increasing SWCNT surface concentration. At a given surface concentration, tubes longer than 200 nm are found to form networks that are more transparent and conducting. We show that changes of sigma with SWCNT concentration can be quantitatively described by the generalized effective medium (GEM) theory. The scaling universal exponents describing the "percolation" transition from an insulating to a conducting state with increasing concentration are consistent with the two-dimensional (2D) percolation model. Shorter tubes and mixed length tubes form 3D networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conductivity percolation threshold (x(c)) varies with the aspect ratio L as, x(c) approximately 1/L, a result that is also in accordance with the percolation theory. These findings provide a framework for engineering the optical and electrical properties of SWCNT networks for technological applications where flexibility, transparency, and conductivity are required.},

abstract = {With Adobe Sign, you can comply with laws and regulatory guidelines-using one scalable signature solution. Government organizations around the world are actively transforming their agency businesses, using digital technologies to deliver agility, efficiency, cost savings and superior constituent experiences. Document signature processes represent one of the biggest opportunities to accelerate this transformation. Government workers spend countless hours hunting down approvals and ink signatures-and then print, scan, fax or mail documents to get the job done. The resulting delays frustrate citizens, departments, suppliers and employees alike. It's little wonder that government organizations have embraced electronic and digital signatures. Today, leading agencies such as the State of Hawaii and the Western Australian Local Government Association (WALGA) get fast, legal and secure signatures electronically. The results are impressive. WALGA has reduced their average time to have contracts signed from 2 weeks or longer to just 80 minutes. The biggest question today isn't whether to adopt electronic signatures-it's how to go about it. While the terms may seem similar, electronic and digital signatures actually describe two different approaches to signing documents-and those differences are linked with signature laws and regulatory requirements. To make the right choice for your agency, you'll want to learn about those differences, understand your unique legal or regulatory environment, and partner with a company you trust-to help you deliver value today and into the future. This paper explores electronic and digital signatures and shows how Adobe solutions let you work with either approach, or a combination of the two. Adobe Sign is an Adobe Document Cloud solution that manages signature processes from end to end, integrates easily with existing government processes and provides a quick return on investment. With over 20 years of experience developing and refining PDF and signature technologies, Adobe is uniquely positioned to help your agency signature processes in compliance with local and global laws as well as regulatory guidelines.},

abstract = {Deterioration of water quality and the unavailability of drinkable water are pressing challenges worldwide. Removal of toxic organic and inorganic pollutants from water is indispensable for a clean environment, as a response to water scarcity, and for human society. Adsorption-based water technologies are among the most favoured and widely used because of their high efficiency at low-cost, without relying on complicated infrastructure. In recent years, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), such as graphene and derivatives, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, nanoporous carbon, fullerenes, graphitic carbon nitride, and nanodiamonds have been extensively exploited as adsorbents due to their extraordinary surface properties, easy modification, large specific surface area, controlled structural varieties, high chemical stability, porosity, low density, ease of regeneration, and reusability. Graphene oxides and other oxidised carbons provide strong acidity and abundant functional groups, and demonstrate excellent adsorption of cationic and basic compounds via electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions, while their pristine counterparts exhibit hydrophobic surfaces and offer high adsorption via strong $\pi$–$\pi$ interactions. This review provides a thorough overview of state of the art in CNMs, including significant past and recent advances, as well as future strategies for the use of carbon-based nanoadsorbents in water treatment. This review primarily emphasises the fundamentals of adsorption, its mechanistic aspects, synthesis and properties of CNMs, and adsorption performances of CNMs and their nanocomposites with inorganic and organics materials. Structural engineering and activation processes produce materials with enhanced adsorptive properties and separation efficiencies. Furthermore, the formation of CNMs with 2D and 3D macro-/micro-structures with high porosities is a potential approach to improve adsorption performances and extend CNMs use at the industrial level. This review also addresses some vital issues that persist about these adsorbents, which could shape the future research and industrial application of carbon-based nanoadsorbents in water security.},

Resonant confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy of an (n,m) individual single-wall nanotube makes it possible to assign its chirality uniquely by measuring one radial breathing mode frequency omega(RBM) and using the theory of resonant transitions. A unique chirality assignment can be made for both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes of diameter d(t), using the parameters gamma(0) = 2.9 eV and omega(RBM) = 248/d(t). For example, the strong RBM intensity observed at 156 cm(-1) for 785 nm laser excitation is assigned to the (13,10) metallic chiral nanotube on a Si/SiO2 surface.},

We have performed several molecular dynamics simulations of a buckyball, C60, cage or idealized atom in a helium fluid flowing axially inside a carbon nanotube. The fluid was started at some initial velocity and both the fluid and buckyball allowed to recycle axially via minimum image boundary conditions. A buckyball introduced into the feedstream (started at zero velocity) usually reached fluid velocity within 5 ps. Leakage rates of helium past the C60 depended on the nanotube diameter and fluid velocity. These leakage rates and other important features of the dynamics changed significantly when C60 was modelled as an idealized atom or when the nanotube was held rigid, suggesting that simulations of fluid dynamics inside nanomachines should be fully dynamic and atomistic.},

abstract = {By using ab initio calculations we investigated the interaction of alkali metal atoms and alkali metal cations with perfect and defective carbon nanotubes. Our results show that the alkali metals prefer to interact with the pentagons and heptagons that appear on the defective site of the carbon nanotube rather than with the hexagons. The alkali metals remain always positively charged not depending on their charge state (neutral, cation) or the different carbon ring that they interact with. The molecular orbital energy level splitting from a defect creation on the carbon nanotube along with the localization of charge-electron density on the defect, results in binding the alkali metals more efficient. More interestingly, metallic sodium appears to bind very weak on the nanotube compared to the rest of alkali metals. The Na anomaly is attributed to the fact that unlike the K case, sodium's inner p shell falls energetically lower than carbon nanotube's p molecular orbitals. As a result, the Na p shell is practically excluded from any binding energy contribution. In the alkali metal cation case the electronegativity trend is followed.},

abstract = {The tetrel bond (TB) recruits an element drawn from the C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb family as electron acceptor in an interaction with a partner Lewis base. The underlying principles that explain this attractive interaction are described in terms of occupied and vacant orbitals, total electron density, and electrostatic potential. These principles facilitate a delineation of the factors that feed into a strong TB. The geometric deformation that occurs within the tetrel-bearing Lewis acid monomer is a particularly important issue, with both primary and secondary effects. As a first-row atom of low polarizability, C is a reluctant participant in TBs, but its preponderance in organic and biochemistry make it extremely important that its potential in this regard be thoroughly understood. The IR and NMR manifestations of tetrel bonding are explored as spectroscopy offers a bridge to experimental examination of this phenomenon. In addition to the most common $\sigma$-hole type TBs, discussion is provided of $\pi$-hole interactions which are a result of a common alternate covalent bonding pattern of tetrel atoms.},

These Wannier functions can be used to interpolate the many-body band structure from the coarse mesh of Brillouin-zone points on which it is known from the initial calculation to the usual symmetry lines, and we demonstrate that this procedure is accurate and efficient for the self-consistent GW band structure. The resemblance of these Wannier functions to the bond orbitals discussed in the chemical community led us to expect differences between density-functional and many-body functions that could be qualitatively interpreted. However, the differences proved to be minimal in the cases studied. Detailed results are presented for SrTiO3 and solid argon.},

The nanotubes in solution were modeled as wormlike polymer chains, yielding a persistence length of 800 nanometers. Nanotubes shorter than this length behave stiffly and stay nearly straight in solution. However, nanotubes longer than the Kuhn segment length of 1600 nanometers undergo considerable thermal fluctuation, suggesting a greater flexibility of these materials than is generally assumed. },

abstract = {This paper reports a novel phenomenon in surface physics, namely the formation of aligned nanogrooves and deep nanoholes on the exit surface of thin (001) gold foils irradiated with high doses of 360, 800 and 1250 keV electrons at temperatures of about 100 K. The grooves and holes, with widths between about 1 and 2 nm, appear to be the smallest so far produced in metals. The formation of the nanogrooves depends on the irradiation direction: irradiation along [001] produces grooves extending along [100] and [010] irradiation along [011] gives grooves along [100], whereas no marked grooves have been observed for [111] irradiations. By contrast, nanoholes, which may reach depths exceeding 20 nm, develop mainly along the beam direction. At room temperature the nanoholes transform into voids of larger diameters. There is strong evidence that the formation of the groove pattern is a self organized process. A tentative mechanism involving symmetry breaking by strongly anisotropic surface collision sequences is proposed. {\textcopyright} 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

The high specific surface area of the Li-CNT composite reduces the local current density and thus suppresses the lithium dendrite formation upon cycling. Moreover, the tailor-designed SEI effectively separates the Li-CNT composite from the electrolyte solution and prevents the latter's further decomposition. When the Li-CNT composite anode is coupled with another CNTm-based O2 cathode, the reversibility and cycle life of the resultant Li-O2 batteries are drastically elevated.},

Theoretical and computational analyses not only provide a better understanding of the intimate behavior of actual batteries under operational and extreme conditions, but they may tailor new materials and shape new architectures in a complementary way to experimental approaches. Modeling can therefore play a very valuable role in the design and lifetime prediction of energy storage materials and devices. Batteries are inherently multi-scale, in space and time. The macro-structural characteristic lengths (the thickness of a single cell, for instance) are order of magnitudes larger than the particles that form the microstructure of the porous electrodes, which in turn are scale-separated from interface layers at which atomistic intercalations occur. Multi-physics modeling concepts, methodologies, and simulations at different scales, as well as scale transition strategies proposed in the recent literature are here revised.

abstract = {We performed an extensive first-principles study of nanowires in various pentagonal structures by using pseudopotential plane wave method within the density functional theory. Our results show that nanowires of different types of elements, such as alkali, simple, transition, and noble metals and inert gas atoms, have a stable structure made from staggered pentagons with a linear chain perpendicular to the planes of the pentagons and passing through their centers. This structure exhibits bond angles close to those in the icosahedral structure. However, silicon is found to be energetically more favorable in the eclipsed pentagonal structure. These quasi-one-dimensional pentagonal nanowires have higher cohesive energies than many other one-dimensional structures and hence may be realized experimentally. The effects of magnetic state are examined by spin-polarized calculations. The origin of the stability is discussed by examining optimized structural parameters, charge density and electronic band structure, and by using analysis based on the empirical Lennard-Jones-type interaction. Electronic band structure of pentagonal wires of different elements are discussed and their effects on quantum ballistic conductance are mentioned. It is found that the pentagonal wire of silicon exhibits metallic band structure. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

We assume that all the incident channels on one side of the sample are fed from the same chemical potential. The transmitted and reflected streams are determined by the incident streams through the multichannel scattering properties of the sample. We do not assume that the channels equilibrate with each other. Our result differs from those given earlier by other authors, except for that of Azbel [J. Phys. C 14, L225 (1981)],which is confirmed. We point out that a similar result is obtained for the conductance in a single channel at a temperature above zero. As an application, we obtain the dependence on channel number N of the contributions to the conductance of a small ring, periodic in the Aharonov-Bohm flux through it.

abstract = {Thermal energy atomic scattering (TEAS) on solid surfaces forms the basis of a useful experimental method for obtaining information about the structure, disorder and phonon spectra of the solid surface. The probe particles (usually He atoms) can spend a relatively long time near the solid surface in the interaction region. The dynamics of the interaction processes cannot be investigated directly at present. However, an appropriate physical model of the interaction fitted to the intensity distribution of the scattering may be suitable for use in investigating the interaction processes theoretically, by computer simulation. The present work emphasizes this computer simulation method. For an actual computer simulation, the detector region TEAS experimental method must be appropriate. Moreover a theoretical model for the TEAS (e.g. a one-particle quantum mechanical wavepacket model governed by the timedependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE)) and a numerical method for solving the TDSE are necessary. The state functions of the consecutive time steps provide enough information to produce an ‘animation' displaying the dynamics of the interaction processes. An ‘animation' is a series of snapshots of e.g. the probability density function (PDF), taken in rapid succession. The sequence of these snapshots provides a ‘movie' of the PDF time evolution. Applications, physical models, numerical solution procedures and simulation techniques relating to the time-dependent wavepacket (TDWP) method are overviewed in the present contribution—especially for the case of TEAS and molecular beam scattering. Several relevant applications of the TDWP method—in the case of TEAS—are discussed (to scattering on ordered, stepped and adsorbed surfaces, the intensity distribution as a function of transfer width, resonant adsorption and trapping, classical and quantum chaos, scattering from vibrating surfaces). Preliminary results on the quantum chaos in TEAS are presented for the first time. The theoretical and computational background (the TDWP and coupled channel methods) as well as applications (to diffraction probability, sticking probability, dissociative adsorption, the steering effect, inelastic channels) of six-dimensional molecule/surface dynamics calculations are described.},

We show that the motifs of isolated point defects in these 2D structures with otherwise very different properties are similar, and include Stone-Wales-type defects formed by structural unit rotations, flower defects and reconstructed double vacancies. The morphology and energetics of extended defects, such as grain boundaries have much in common as well.

abstract = {The potential of graphene-based materials consisting of one or a few layers of graphite for integrated electronics originates from the large room-temperature carrier mobility in these systems (approximately 10,000 cm2 V(-1) s(-1)). However, the realization of electronic devices such as field-effect transistors will require controlling and even switching off the electrical conductivity by means of gate electrodes, which is made difficult by the absence of a bandgap in the intrinsic material. Here, we demonstrate the controlled induction of an insulating state--with large suppression of the conductivity--in bilayer graphene, by using a double-gate device configuration that enables an electric field to be applied perpendicular to the plane. The dependence of the resistance on temperature and electric field, and the absence of any effect in a single-layer device, strongly suggest that the gate-induced insulating state originates from the recently predicted opening of a bandgap between valence and conduction bands.},

abstract = {The intercalation and diffusion of lithium ions in a bundle of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are investigated via an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation method based on the density functional theory. We found that lithium ions quickly penetrate into the CNTs and the space between neighboring CNTs. With a low Li ion density, the Li ions tend to stay close to the nanotube ends. Interestingly, Li ions are able to penetrate through the carbon nanotube and move from one end to the other. We also discovered that Li ions may remain between two neighboring CNTs, which presents a new approach for Li ion intercalation and storage. Importantly, Li ions located among three neighboring CNTs have very strong adsorption potentials that are a factor of four larger than those of Li ions located along the central axis of a single-walled nanotube (SWNT). This indicates that Li ions located among three neighboring CNTs would be very difficult to remove from a nanotube bundle, which suggests that Li storage capacity in this case is possibly irreversible, and that keeping the nanotubes apart with an appropriate distance would hinder or promote the formation of irreversible intercalation. Our findings contribute to the understanding of lithium intercalation and diffusion in CNTs, which has implications for the experimental development and application of rechargeable Li ion batteries.},

abstract = {Evaporated (111) gold foils 200-1000 {\AA} thick have been irradiated with electrons in a high voltage electron microscope at energies from 0{\textperiodcentered}5 to 1{\textperiodcentered}1 MeV to study the sputtering behaviour. Transmission-sputtered atoms were collected on a carbon film and their spatial distribution was determined by X-ray microanalysis. The angular distribution of sputtered intensity was found to be strongly energy- dependent, exhibiting a single central maximum for 0{\textperiodcentered}5 MeV and three symmetrically disposed maxima for energies above 0{\textperiodcentered}6 MeV, all of which became increasingly sharp at higher energies. The main features of the results are explained at an atomic level with the aid of a molecular dynamics programme, and the roles of collision sequences, steering of trajectories by neighbouring atoms, and thermal vibration effects are elucidated. We find that, at energies <0{\textperiodcentered}6 MeV, surface atoms are sputtered by direct recoils only, whereas, at energies >0{\textperiodcentered}6 MeV, up to $\sim$40% of the total yield comprises surface atoms sputtered by sub-surface recoils which generate focused collision sequences down <110> directions. {\textcopyright} 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The MWNTs are synthesized on supported catalysts by thermal chemical vapour deposition, purified, and mechanically ball-milled by the high energy ball-milling. The purified MWNTs and the ball-milled MWNTs were electrochemically inserted with Li. Structural and chemical modifications in the ball-milled MWNTs change the insertion-extraction properties of Li ions into/from the ball-milled MWNTs. The reversible capacity (Crev) increases with increasing ball-milling time, namely, from 351 mAh g-1 (Li0.9C6) for the purified MWNTs to 641 mAh g-1 (Li1.7C6) for the ball-milled MWNTs. The undesirable irreversible capacity (Cirr) decreases continuously with increase in the ball-milling time, namely, from 1012 mAh g-1 (Li2.7C6) for the purified MWNTs to 518 mAh g-1 (Li1.4C6) for the ball-milled MWNTs. The decrease in Cirr of the ball-milled samples results in an increase in the coulombic efficiency from 25% for the purified samples to 50% for the ball-milled samples. In addition, the ball-milled samples maintain a more stable capacity than the purified samples during charge-discharge cycling. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We perform molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate lithiation induced fracture mechanisms of defective single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Our simulations reveal that variations of defect size and lithium concentration set two distinct fracture modes of the SWCNTs upon uniaxial stretch: abrupt and retarded fracture. Abrupt fracture either involves spontaneous lithium weakening of the propagating crack tip or is absent of lithium participation, while retarded fracture features a "wait-and-go" crack extension process in which the crack tip periodically arrests and waits to be weakened by diffusing lithium before extension resumes. Our study sheds light on the rational design of high-performance CNT-based electrodes. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The study of simple metal clusters has burgeoned in the last decade, motivated by the growing interest in the evolution of physical properties from the atom to the bulk solid, a progression passing through the domain of atomic clusters. On the experimental side, the rapid development of new techniques for producing the clusters and for probing and detecting them has resulted in a phenomenal increase in our knowledge of these systems. For clusters of the simplest metals, the alkali and noble metals, the electronic structure is dominated by the number of valence electrons, and the ionic cores are of secondary importance. These electrons are delocalized, and the electronic system exhibits a shell structure that is closely related to the well-known nuclear shell structure. In this article the results from a broad range of experi- ments are reviewed and compared with theory. Included are the behavior of the mass-abundance spectra, polarizabilities, ionization potentials, photoelectron spectra, optical spectra, and fragmentation phenomena.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) revealing metallic or semiconductive properties depending on the folding modes of the nanotube walls represent a novel class of nanowires. Different methods to separate semiconductive CNTs from conductive CNTs have been developed, and synthetic strategies to chemically modify the side walls or tube ends by molecular or biomolecular components have been reported. Tailoring hybrid systems consisting of CNTs and biomolecules (proteins and DNA) has rapidly expanded and attracted substantial research effort. The integration of biomaterials with CNTs enables the use of the hybrid systems as active field-effect transistors or biosensor devices (enzyme electrodes, immunosensors, or DNA sensors). Also, the integration of CNTs with biomolecules has allowed the generation of complex nanostructures and nanocircuitry of controlled properties and functions. The rapid progress in this interdisciplinary field of CNT-based nanobioelectronics and nanobiotechnology is reviewed by summarizing the present scientific accomplishments, and addressing the future goals and perspectives of the area.},

Based on both the principle of energy minimization and a generalized Euler's rule, it is demonstrated that the most stable structure for X junctions contains only 12 heptagons.

abstract = {A clean and simple wet chemical process using dilute aqueous ozone (O3) solution with or without ultrasound (US) was used to functionalize single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Both O3 and O3/US treatments greatly increased the stability of SWCNTs in water. Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the surface oxygen to carbon atomic ratio increased by more than 600% after 72 h of O3 treatment. Moreover, the effective particle size of SWCNTs was reduced from the initial 4400 to ∼300 and ∼150 nm, after 24 h of O3 and O3/US treatment, respectively. The zeta potential of treated SWCNTs decreased from 3.0 to -35.0 mV (at pH 4) after 2 h of treatment with both O3 and O3/US. Based on the XPS results, the oxidation pathway was proposed: at the onset of the oxidation reaction, the C{double bond, long}C double bond was first converted to {single bond}C{single bond}OH which was then oxidized to {single bond}C{double bond, long}O and O{double bond, long}C{single bond}OH concurrently. Oxidation reactions could be described well with first order expressions. Treatment time controlled the extent of surface oxidation and subsequently the stability and dispersion of SWCNTs in water. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The maximum adsorption energy (A.E) value is −44.50 kj/mol which indicates the adsorption of all complexes is physisorption type and our complexes benefit from the short recovery time. Weak electrostatic nature of the interaction is also revealed by the QTAIM study. The reduction of Eg for the adsorption of ML on BN sheet is the highest (up to 55%) indicating the highest sensitivity while the sensitivity trend is $\sigma$ (BN) > $\sigma$ (GNS) > $\sigma$ (BC3). The UV–Vis spectra investigation also validates this sensitivity trend. The dipole moment and A.E data in case of the solvent effect upon the complexes claim the favourable adsorption process in aqueous medium. Consequently, this comparative study reveals the ability of BN nanosheet to sense ML drug is higher than that of GNS and BC3, which will help to protect human and wildlife from the side effect of this drug.},

Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) offers the potential to probe this prediction, as it can resolve simultaneously both atomic structure and the electronic density of states. Previous STM studies of multi-walled nanotubes6, 7, 8, 9 and single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs)10 have provided indications of differing structures and diameter-dependent electronic properties, but have not revealed any explicit relationship between structure and electronic properties. Here we report STM measurements of the atomic structure and electronic properties of SWNTs. We are able to resolve the hexagonal-ring structure of the walls, and show that the electronic properties do indeed depend on diameter and helicity. We find that the SWNT samples exhibit many different structures, with no one species dominating.},

The mechanism of the direct electrodeposition of gold nanotube arrays by cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been discussed. The morphological characterizations of the gold nanotube arrays have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was constructed by attaching gold nanotube arrays (using AAO) onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrochemical behavior of AA and UA at this modified electrode has been studied by CV and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The sensor offers an excellent response for AA and UA and the linear response range for AA and UA were 1.02 × 10 - 7-5.23 × 10 - 4 mol L - 1 and 1.43 × 10 - 7-4.64 × 10 - 4 mol L - 1, the detection limits were 1.12 × 10 - 8 mol L - 1 and 2.24 × 10 - 8 mol L - 1, respectively.

In this design, an aptamer is engineered to be two pieces of random, coil-like single-stranded DNA, which reassembles into the intact aptamer tertiary structure in the presence of the specific target. AuNPs can effectively differentiate between these two states via their characteristic surface-plasmon resonance-based color change. Using this method, cocaine in the low-micromolar range is selectively detected within minutes. This strategy is also shown to be generic and applicable to the detection of several other small-molecule targets. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.},

We employ a nonorthogonal spd-tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a local charge neutrality assumption. The conductance and charge distributions for finite bias are calculated using the nonequilibrium-Green-function formalism. We calculate the voltage drop through the contacts and find the main drop located near the negative electrode. We argue that this is due to the filled d-state resonances. The conduction is analyzed in terms of transmission eigenchannels and density of states of the eigenchannels projected onto tight-binding orbitals. We find a single almost fully transmitting channel with mainly s character for low bias while for high bias this channel becomes less transmitting and additional channels involving only d orbitals start to conduct. {\textcopyright}1999 The American Physical Society.},

Our results show that in the presence of divacancy Li adatom energetically prefers the hollow site above the center of an octagonal ring rather than the top sites of carbon atoms next to vacancy site. In the case of Stone?Wales defect, Li atom is energetically favorable to be adsorbed on the top site of carbon atom in a pentagonal ring shared with two hexagonal rings, and such adsorption results in a bucking of graphene sheet. For divacancy and Stone?Wales defects in graphene, their interactions with a Li adatom are attractive, suggesting that the presence of point defects would enhance the Li adsorption on graphene. The difference charge density and the Bader charge analysis both show that there is a significant charge transfer from Li adatom to it nearest neighbor carbon atoms.},

abstract = {High-resolution photoelectron imaging and spectroscopy of cold C 60- anions are reported using a newly built photoelectron imaging apparatus coupled with an electrospray ionization source and a temperature-controlled cryogenic ion trap. Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra are obtained for the detachment transition from the ground state of C60- to that of C60 at various detachment wavelengths from 354.84 nm to 461.35 nm. The electron affinity of C60 is accurately measured to be 2.6835 ± 0.0006 eV. Numerous unexpected vibrational excitations are observed in the photoelectron spectra due to the Jahn-Teller effect in C60- and Hertzberg-Teller vibronic coupling in both C60- and C60. Both the relative intensities of vibrational peaks and their photoelectron angular distributions provide evidence for the vibronic couplings. The observed p-wave-like behavior in the angular distribution of the 000 transition suggests that the electron is detached from an s-type orbital. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The effect can be attributed to simple stretching of the tube under tip deformation, which opens up an energy gap at the Fermi surface. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {At semiconductor-metal junctions, the Schottky barrier height is generally fixed by "Fermi-level pinning". We find that when a semiconducting carbon nanotube is end-contacted to a metal (the optinal geometry for nanodevices), the behavior is radically different. Even when the Fermi level is fully "pinned" at the interface, the turn-on voltage is that expected for the unpinned junction. Thus the threshold may be adjusted for optimal device performance, which is not possible in planar contacts. Similar behavior is expected at heterojunctions between nanotubes and semiconductors.},

In spite of different models, methods and experimental conditions employed to obtain the topological properties of $\rho$(r), we show that, for closed-shell interactions, the kinetic energy density G(rCP) and the potential energy density V(rCP) at the critical point depend exponentially on the H⋯O distance. Moreover, theoretical calculations for several HB dissociation energies follow the same law as does V(rCP), with a simple change of scale.},

Chapter 1 provides a description of quantum transport in elementary terms accessible to a beginner. The book then works its way from hydrogen to nanostructures, with extensive coverage of current flow. The final chapter summarizes the equations for quantum transport with illustrative exam-ples showing how conductors evolve from the atomic to the ohmic regime as they get larger. Many numerical examples are used to provide concrete illustrations and the cor-responding M at l a b codes can be downloaded from the web. Videostreamed lectures, keyed to specific sections of the book, are also available through the web. This book is primarily aimed at senior and graduate students.},

The latter experiment requires no contacts to either end of the molecule. From our experiments we conclude that adsorbed individual DNA molecules have a resistivity similar to mica, glass, and silicon oxide substrates. Therefore adsorbed DNA is not a conductor, and it should not be considered as a viable candidate for MW applications.

Upon the formation of AuNTs from planar Au belts, the energy of Au-dxy and Au-dx2-y2 bands is upshifted, which thus decreases the cohesive energy.

abstract = {We study the applicability of the semiclassical Feynman and Hibbs (FH) (second-order or fourth-order) effective potentials to the description of the thermodynamic properties of quantum fluids at finite temperatures. First, we use path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to estimate the thermodynamic/static properties of our model quantum fluid, i.e. low-density 4He at 10 K. With PIMC we obtain the experimental equation of state, the single-particle mean kinetic energy, the single-particle density matrix and the single-particle momentum distribution of this system at low densities. We show that our PIMC results are in full agreement with experimental data obtained with deep inelastic neutron scattering at high momentum transfers (D. Colognesi, C. Andreani, R. Senesi, Europhys. Lett., 2000, 50, 202). As expected, in this region of the 4He phase diagram, quantum effects modify the width of the single-particle momentum distribution but do not alter its Gaussian shape. Knowing the exact values of density, pressure and single-particle mean kinetic energy for our model quantum fluid, we investigate the limitations of the semiclassical FH effective potentials. We show that commonly used 'short-time' approximations to the high-temperature density matrix due to Feynman and Hibbs can only be applied in a very limited range of the 4He phase diagram. We found that FH effective potentials reproduce the experimental densities of 4He at 10 K for Lambda/a < 0.45 (Lambda = 2.73 A denotes the thermal de Broglie wavelength, a = rho(-1/3) is the mean nearest-neighbor distance in the fluid and rho denotes fluid density). Moreover, semiclassical FH effective potentials are able to correctly predict the single-particle mean kinetic energy of 4He at 10 K in a very limited range of fluid densities, i.e.Lambda/a < 0.17. We show that the ad hoc application of the semiclassical FH effective potentials for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of dense liquid-like para-hydrogen (para-H2) adsorbed in nanoporous materials below 72 K is questionable.},

abstract = {Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is produced in large quantities in the production of olive oil with the three-phase method. This waste, which is not biodegradable and characterized by a heavy organic load containing toxic components (such as phenols), is usually given to aqueous receptors or soil, either directly (untreated) or treated inadequately. Biologically active phenolic compounds that inhibit biodegradation of this waste are toxic at high concentrations, especially for microorganisms, but have positive effects with strong antioxidant properties on human health when properly isolated and properly concentrated. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is one of the most interesting and abundant compounds among the biophenols present in OMW. According to this study, a newly synthesized nanomaterial, graphene oxide (GO), has been utilized for the separation of HT and total biophenolic substance from OMW. Graphene oxide from graphite oxidation was synthesized using a modified Hummer's method. In order to understand how GO behaves during thermal degradation, thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry analyses were performed. Two-parameter and three-parameter equilibrium isotherm models and kinetic models have been used to determine the mechanism of kinetic sorption and adsorption type. Thermodynamic data indicate that the adsorption process is exothermic, applicable and spontaneous.},

abstract = {Health is the fundamental capability humans require to perceive, feel, and act effectively, and as such, it represents a primary element in the development of the individual, but also of the environment humans belongs to. That is why it is necessary to provide adequate ways and means to ensure the appropriate healthcare delivery based on parameters monitoring and direct providing of the medical assistance. The new technologies development and implementation, especially the Internet and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), enable global approach to the health care system infrastructure development. This leads to e-health system that, in real time manner, supplies a valuable set of information relevant to all of the stakeholders (patients, medical and paramedical stuff, and health insurance) regardless their current location. Commercial systems in this area usually do not meet the general patient needs, and those that do are usually economically unacceptable due to the high operational and development costs. In this paper, based on well-known low-cost technologies, there is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solution for a sustainable and adaptable patient oriented infrastructure development, presented.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is a (in principle exact) theory of electronic structure, based on the electron density distribution n(r), instead of the many-electron wave function $\Psi$(r1,r2,r3,...). Having been widely used for over 30 years by physicists working on the electronic structure of solids, surfaces, defects, etc., it has more recently also become popular with theoretical and computational chemists. The present article is directed at the chemical community. It aims to convey the basic concepts and breadth of applications: the current status and trends of approximation methods (local density and generalized gradient approximations, hybrid methods) and the new light which DFT has been shedding on important concepts like electronegativity, hardness, and chemical reactivity index.},

The method allows transferability to be improved systematically while holding the cutoff radius fixed, even for large cutoff radii. Novel features are that the pseudopotential itself becomes charge-state dependent, the usual norm-conservation constraint does not apply, and a generalized eigenproblem is introduced. The potentials have a separable form well suited for plane-wave solid-state calculations, and show promise for application to first-row and transition-metal systems.},

We show that resonant conditions are necessary for investigating phonon modes of BNNTs. Raman excitation in the UV (229 nm) provides preresonant conditions, allowing the identification of the A 1 tangential mode at 1370 cm -1. This is 5 cm -1 higher than the E 2g mode in bulk h-BN. Ab initio calculations show that the lower frequency of bulk h-BN with respect to large diameter nanotubes and the single sheet of h-BN is related to a softening of the sp 2 bonds in the bulk due to interlayer interaction. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The effect of electrochemical oxidation in 0.2 M HNO 3 for multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) on the performance of electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) was studied. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope images reveal that electrochemical oxidation increases the specific area of MWNTs by cutting off the nanotube tips. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current charging/discharging was used to characterize the behavior of EDLCs of the oxidized-MWNTs in 1.0 M H 2SO 4. The specific capacitance of the oxidized-MWNTs was remarkably improved. The maximum specific capacitance of 335.2 ± 13.1 F g -1 (n = 3) was obtained for the oxidized-MWNTs with open tips, which is 11 times than that of normal MWNTs (32.7 ± 7.1 F g -1). Electrochemical oxidation is hence an effective way to improve the performances of the MWNTs electrodes in EDLCs application. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bansal2018,
abstract = {Epoxy resins have been extensively utilized for mechanical strength applications in the field of aerospace, automobiles, marine, defence, etc. Improving the strength as well as fracture behaviour of the light weight materials is challenging. Present work is an attempt to enhance elastic modulus, hardness and fracture resistance simultaneously by reinforcing the epoxy (bisphenol-A) matrix with a new-age two-dimensional atomically thin graphene oxide filler. Wet chemical oxidation method was used to prepare graphene oxide sheets. Morphological study of the synthesized graphene oxide was carried out using scanning electron microscopy. Fourier-transformed infrared, ultraviolet–visible and Raman spectroscopic techniques were also employed to ascertain the synthesis of graphene oxide. The results confirmed the synthesis of well oxidized graphene oxide sheets. The prepared graphene oxide sheets were then sonicated in acetone solution to ensure better dispersion in the bisphenol-A graphene oxide nano-composite using 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt.% graphene oxide reinforcement. Solution mixing method was used to synthesize the polymer nano-composite. Scanning electron microscopy results revealed the smooth dispersion of graphene oxide in the bisphenol-A matrix. Nano-indentation of the bisphenol-A graphene oxide nano-composite showed a considerable jump in elastic modulus at 1 wt.% and hardness at 0.50 wt.% of graphene oxide reinforcement. Fracture resistance of bisphenol-A graphene oxide composite as represented by ratio of elastic modulus to hardness was enhanced by 24% as compared to the pristine bisphenol-A. Our results demonstrate a promising way to improve the mechanical characteristics of epoxy resins through graphene oxide reinforcement at low weight percentages.},

abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical study of pristine single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and SWCNT co- doped with combinations of Aluminum (Al), Phosphorous (P) and Nitrogen (N) along with their dielectric function spectra and calculated refractive indices. Dielectric function spectra of a pristine SWCNT and the SWCNT co-doped with Aluminum (Al) & Phosphorus (P) and another one co-doped with Al, P and Nitrogen (N) have been calculated using density functional theory implemented through the Cambridge sequential total energy package (CASTEP). The spectra show the variation of real and imaginary part of the dielectric function with frequency of the incident light. Polarized and unpolarized light as well as light through polycrystalline media has been considered. The value of static refractive index has been calculated using these curves. A substantial increase in the value of the static refractive index is observed when a pristine SWCNT is co-doped with Al and P but if in addition N atom is also introduced, a reduction in the value of static refractive index is observed though it does not fall lower than that of the pristine SWCNT. Thus, we propose that co-doping with atoms of different combinations of elements can be used as a novel and effective tool to manipulate the dielectric function and refractive index of SWCNTs and can pave the way to effective designing of various sensitive optical devices using SWCNTs for a variety of technological applications.},

abstract = {Black core-shelled anatase titania were successfully prepared using a simple one-step synthetic method by calcining colloid titania precursor in N2 flow under atmospheric pressure. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microcopy, etc. The samples demonstrate a unique core-shelled structure and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra reveal the presence of high concentration of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies at the surface, which accounts for their black appearance. A possible mechanism for the formation of such core-shell structure is proposed based on the results (X-ray photoelectron spectra, etc) of products prepared under different ration between urea and hydrochloric acid. Ethanol absolute is found to have critical effect in preventing phase transition of titania (from anatase to rutile) upon elevated temperatures. The black appearance of the sample powder (high visible light absorption) as well as slow electron/hole recombination rate after introducing oxygen vacancies/N species signify the core-shelled anatase titania as an efficient visible light active photocatalyst.},

abstract = {Herein, we investigate sulfur substitutional defects in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene by using first-principles calculations. The estimated formation energies for the (3,3), (5,5), and (10,0) SWCNTs and graphene lie between 0.9 and 3.8 eV, at sulfur concentrations of 1.7-4 atom %. Thus, from a thermodynamic standpoint, sulfur doping is not difficult. Indeed, these values can be compared with that of 0.7 eV obtained for a nitrogen-doped (5,5) SWCNT. We suggest that it may be possible to introduce sulfur into the SWCNT framework by employing sulfur-containing heterocycles. Our simulations indicate that sulfur doping can modify the electronic structure of the SWCNTs and graphene, depending on the sulfur content. In the case of graphene, sulfur doping can induce different effects: the doped sheet can be a small-band-gap semiconductor, or it can have better metallic properties than the pristine sheet. Thus, S-doped graphene may be a smart choice for constructing nanoelectronic devices, since it is possible to modulate the electronic properties of the sheet by adjusting the amount of sulfur introduced. Different synthetic routes to produce sulfur-doped graphene are discussed.},

abstract = {Advanced nanomaterials play a prominent role in nanoscience and nanotechnology developments, opening new frontiers in these areas. Among these nanomaterials, due to their unique characteristics and enhanced chemical and physical properties, inorganic nanotubes have been considered one of the most interesting nanostructures. In recent years, important progress has been achieved in the production and study of these nanomaterials, including boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubular structures, misfit-based nanotubes and other hybrid/doped nanotubular objects. This review is devoted to the in-depth analysis of recent studies on the synthesis, atomic structures, properties and applications of inorganic nanotubes and related nanostructures. Particular attention is paid to the growth mechanism of these nanomaterials. This is a crucial point for the challenges ahead related to the mass production of high-quality defect-free nanotubes for a variety of applications.},

abstract = {The problem of deriving atomic charges from the results of ab Initio MO calculations has been studied by the use of several reported methods: Mulliken population analysis, the minimal basis set (MBS) procedure, the natural population analysis (NPA), two electrostatic potential fitting methods, M-K and ChelpG, the Hirshfeld population analysis, and CM5 (charge model 5), which is related to the Hirshfeld method. The first set of studies were concerned with hydrogen charges. It was found that the MBS charges were linearly related to the Hirshfeld charges. The Hirshfeld, CM5, and MBS methods, but not the others, provided an excellent correlation for H atomic charge with the H-C-H bond angle, and with calculated gas-phase acidity. The two methods that were linearly related and gave hydrogen charges in agreement with an experimental study of partially deuterated methanes are MBS and Hirshfeld. In order to see which of the two methods is the more satisfactory, the methanol dimer was examined. The calculated H bond energy was 6.2 kcal/mol, which was in good agreement with studies of hydrogen bonds. The Coulombic interaction for the O{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H bond was estimated using the MBS and Hirshfeld charges. The latter gave a calculated energy of 3-6 kcal/mol, whereas MBS gave an energy of ∼35 kcal/mol. Clearly, the Hirshfeld method is more satisfactory and should be the method of choice.},

abstract = {Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are used to investigate pressure-driven water flow passing through carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes at low pressures (5.0 MPa) typical of real nanofiltration (NF) systems. The CNT membrane is modeled as a simplified NF membrane with smooth surfaces, and uniform straight pores of typical NF pore sizes. A NEMD simulation system is constructed to study the effects of the membrane structure (pores size and membrane thickness) on the pure water transport properties. All simulations are run under operating conditions (temperature and pressure difference) similar to a real NF processes. Simulation results are analyzed to obtain water flux, density, and velocity distributions along both the flow and radial directions. Results show that water flow through a CNT membrane under a pressure difference has the unique transport properties of very fast flow and a non-parabolic radial distribution of velocities which cannot be represented by the Hagen-Poiseuille or Navier-Stokes equations. Density distributions along radial and flow directions show that water molecules in the CNT form layers with an oscillatory density profile, and have a lower average density than in the bulk flow. The NEMD simulations provide direct access to dynamic aspects of water flow through a CNT membrane and give a view of the pressure-driven transport phenomena on a molecular scale.},

abstract = {Multibranched gold nanoparticles (M-AuNPs) can serve as photothermal agents for near-infrared (NIR) photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer, but a major shortcoming is that they tend to strongly scatter NIR light, causing a significant reduction in absorption. This work addresses this issue, based on theoretical simulations and experimental determinations, to enhance the absorption and reduce the scattering of these materials by screening their structural parameters. Our finite-difference time-domain simulations predict that M-AuNPs with a core size of ∼25 nm, a tip number of 5, and a tip height of ∼40 nm (i.e., an aspect ratio of ∼2) are optimal for trapping NIR light and yielding the highest light-to-heat conversion efficiency ($\eta$) and for trapping NIR light of various polarization and incident directions. The predicted M-AuNPs were synthesized by a seed-mediated growth method, and the measured optical properties agreed well with the simulation results. The M-AuNPs were further used as photothermal agents for in vitro killing of MCF-7 cells and in vivo ablation of tumors constructed on nude mice. Nearly all cells died after they were incubated with M-AuNPs and irradiated under an 808 nm laser at a 1.0 W cm -2 for 10 min. The tumors on the nude mice were also effectively ablated without regrowth during the observation period (20 days) after PTT.},

Various types of synthesis techniques for CNTs are the arc-discharge method, laser ablation method; chemical vapor deposition method, vapor-phase growth, flame synthesis method, and plasma-assisted growth of CNTs. CNTs have inimitable kind of properties like mechanical, electrical, and optical. These properties can even be measured on single nanotubes.

abstract = {Lithium ion batteries are receiving considerable attention in applications, ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles, due to their superior energy density over other rechargeable battery technologies. However, the societal demands for lighter, thinner, and higher capacity lithium ion batteries necessitate ongoing research for novel materials with improved properties over that of state-of-the-art. Such an effort requires a concerted development of both electrodes and electrolyte to improve battery capacity, cycle life, and charge-discharge rates while maintaining the highest degree of safety available. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a candidate material for use in lithium ion batteries due to their unique set of electrochemical and mechanical properties. The incorporation of CNTs as a conductive additive at a lower weight loading than conventional carbons, like carbon black and graphite, presents a more effective strategy to establish an electrical percolation network. In addition, CNTs have the capability to be assembled into free-standing electrodes (absent of any binder or current collector) as an active lithium ion storage material or as a physical support for ultra high capacity anode materials like silicon or germanium. The measured reversible lithium ion capacities for CNT-based anodes can exceed 1000 mAh g-1 depending on experimental factors, which is a 3[times] improvement over conventional graphite anodes. The major advantage from utilizing free-standing CNT anodes is the removal of the copper current collectors which can translate into an increase in specific energy density by more than 50% for the overall battery design. However, a developmental effort needs to overcome current research challenges including the first cycle charge loss and paper crystallinity for free-standing CNT electrodes. Efforts to utilize pre-lithiation methods and modification of the single wall carbon nanotube bundling are expected to increase the energy density of future CNT batteries. Other progress may be achieved using open-ended structures and enriched chiral fractions of semiconducting or metallic chiralities that are potentially able to improve capacity and electrical transport in CNT-based lithium ion batteries.},

abstract = {The stable tubelike Au(N) (N=26-28) has been found using the scalar relativistic all-electron density functional theory calculations, which becomes another powerful candidate for the lowest-energy Au(N), competing in energy with those space-filled structures suggested previously. Unlike the icosahedral "golden" fullerene Au32, these tubelike gold clusters may be closely related to the synthesized single-wall gold nanotubes (SWGNTs). The ground-state Au26 has a hollow tubelike structure constructed from the (6, 0) SWGNT, yielding a high-symmetry D6d cage, based upon which the most stable Au27 and Au28 can be obtained by adding one and two more capped atoms on its one end, respectively.},

abstract = {Rydberg level energies for Li7 were measured using triple-resonance laser excitation, followed by drifted field ionization. In addition to the principal n P2 series, weak Stark mixing from residual electric fields allowed observation of n S2 and hydrogenic Stark manifold series at higher n. Limit analyses for the series yield the spectroscopic ionization energy EI (Li7) =43 487.159 40 (18) cm-1. The Li 6,7 isotope shift (IS) was measured in selected n P2 Rydberg levels and extrapolation to the series limit yields IS (EI) 7,6 =18 067.54 (21) MHz. Results are compared with recent theoretical calculations: EI values from experiment and theory agree to within 0.0011 cm-1, with the remaining discrepancy comparable to uncertainty in QED corrections of order $\alpha$4 Ry. The difference between experiment and calculated mass-based IS (EI) yields a change in nuclear charge radii between the two isotopes $\delta$ r2 7,6 =-0.60 (10) fm2. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A positive $\pi$-hole is a region of positive electrostatic potential that is perpendicular to a portion of a molecular framework. It is the counterpart of a $\sigma$-hole, which is along the extension of a covalent bond to an atom. Both $\sigma$-holes and $\pi$-holes become more positive (a) in going from the lighter to the heavier atoms in a given Group of the periodic table, and (b) as the remainder of the molecule is more electronwithdrawing. Positive $\sigma$- and $\pi$-holes can interact in a highly directional manner with negative sites, e.g., the lone pairs of Lewis bases. In this work, the complexes of 13 $\pi$-holecontaining molecules with the nitrogen lone pairs of HCN and NH 3 have been characterized computationally using the MP2, M06-2X and B3PW91 procedures. While the electrostatic interaction is a major driving force in $\pi$-hole bonding, a gradation is found from weakly noncovalent to considerably stronger with possible indications of some degree of coordinate covalency. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

The fundamental scattering mechanisms governing the electrical transport in nanotubes are discussed, along with the properties of p–n and Schottkybarrier junctions in semiconductor tubes. The use of advanced nanotube devices for electronic, high-frequency, and electromechanical applications is discussed. We then examine quantum transport in carbon nanotubes, including the observation of quantized conductance, proximity-induced supercurrents, and spin-dependent ballistic transport. We move on to explore the properties of single and coupled carbon-nanotube quantum dots. Spin and orbital (isospin) magnetic moments lead to fourfold shell structure and unusual Kondo phenomena. We conclude with a discussion of unanswered questions and a look to future research directions.},

In particular, subsequent to brief surveys of the most-commonly used methods of preparation and arraying of materials with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and of the optical manifestations of LSPR, attention will be focused on the exploitation of metallic nanostructures as waveguides; as optical transmission, information storage, and nanophotonic devices; as switches; as resonant light scatterers (employed in the different near-field scanning optical microscopies); and finally as sensors and biosensors.},

@article{Anikina2019,
abstract = {We investigated Li-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a promising hydrogen storage media. In this computational model, we considered isolated lithium atom adsorbed on a CNT wall as an adsorption site for hydrogen. We focused on the influence of size effects on the structural and energetic characteristics of CNT(n,n)@Li+kH2 complexes where n = 5, 7, 9; k = 1,..., 6; Nc = 4, 5, 6 (Nc is translation length of CNT, expressed in terms of a number of CNT unit cells). We proved that modeled CNT length substantially influences internal sorption of Li and hydrogen on the narrow tube (5,5), which subsequently alters the adsorption energies of H2 molecules and causes the deformation of the carbon framework. Moreover, the size effects are not pronounced in the case of external sorption for all considered CNT translation lengths and diameters. We have not observed any noticeable qualitative difference between internal and external hydrogen sorption in the nanotube wider than CNT(5,5). In the case of external adsorption on all considered nanotubes, doping with Li increases hydrogen adsorption energies of up to four H2 molecules by 100 meV in comparison with pure CNTs. And the local density approximation estimations (-250 meV/H2) of adsorption energy on Li-decorated CNTs exceed the lowest requirement proposed by the U.S. Department of Energy (200 meV/H2). In the case of internal sorption on Li-functionalized tubes, the generalized gradient approximation also gives hydrogen adsorption energies in the desired range of 200-600 meV/H2. However, steric hindrances could prevent sufficient hydrogen uptakes (less than 2 wt % inside CNT(5,5)). We believe that our findings on the size effects are important for estimation of CNT's hydrogen storage properties.},

abstract = {Gold clusters, which display a variety of unusual geometric structures due to their strong relativistic effects, have attracted much attention. Among them, Au26 has a high-symmetry tubular structure (D6d) with a large HOMO-LUMO energy gap, but its electronic stability still remains unclear. In this paper, the electronic nature of the Au26 cluster is investigated using the density functional theory method. Depending on the super valence bond model, the tubular Au26 cluster with 26 valence electrons could be viewed as a superatomic molecule composed of two open cages based on spherical aromaticity, and its molecule-like electronic shell closure is achieved via a super triple bond ($\sigma$, 2$\pi$) between the two cages. Based on this new cage-cage superatomic structural model, a series of similar tubular clusters are predicted from the Au26 skeleton. The two capped Au atoms are replaced by Cu, Ag and In atoms, respectively, to form tubular D6d Au24Cu2 and Au24Ag2 (26e) and Au24In2 (30e) clusters, where the super triple bonds also exist. Moreover, tubular D5d Au20In2 (26e) is obtained by replacing hexatomic Au6 rings in the bulk of Au24In2 with pentagonal Au5 rings. Chemical bonding analysis reveals that there is a super quintuple bond ($\sigma$, 2$\pi$, 2$\delta$) between two open (Au10In) cages, in accordance with the 26e Li20Mg3 superatomic molecule composed of two icosahedral superatoms. Our study proposes the new cage-cage structural model of superatomic molecules based on spherical aromaticity, which extends the range of the super valence bonding pattern and gives inferences for further study of superatomic clusters.},

Effects of analytes' physisorption on the surface of BNNTs regarding structural and electronic properties were delineated. Relatively large binding energies were calculated, however, with minimal perturbation of the structural framework. Electronic structure calculations indicated that the bandgap of BNNTs can be modified by weak adsorption due to the presence of adsorbate states in the gap of the host system. Furthermore, we have shown that the application of a transverse electric field can tune the bandgap by shifting adsorbate states, consistent with calculated current-voltage characteristics.},

@article{Siwy2005,
abstract = {There is increasing interest in the concept of using nanopores as the sensing elements in biosensors. The nanopore most often used is the $\alpha$-hemolysin protein channel, and the sensor consists of a single channel embedded within a lipid bilayer membrane. An ionic current is passed through the channel, and analyte species are detected as transient blocks in this current associated with translocation of the analyte through the channel-stochastic sensing. While this is an extremely promising sensing paradigm, it would be advantageous to eliminate the very fragile lipid bilayer membrane and perhaps to replace the biological nanopore with an abiotic equivalent. We describe here a new family of protein biosensors that are based on conically shaped gold nanotubes embedded within a mechanical and chemically robust polymeric membrane. While these sensors also function by passing an ion current through the nanotube, the sensing paradigm is different from the previous devices in that a transient change in the current is not observed. Instead, the protein analyte binds to a biochemical molecular-recognition agent at the mouth of the conical nanotube, resulting in complete blockage of the ion current. Three different molecular-recognition agents, and correspondingly three different protein analytes, were investigated: (i) biotin/streptavidin, (ii) protein-G/immunoglobulin, and (iii) an antibody to the protein ricin with ricin as the analyte.

@article{Ohnishi1998,
abstract = {As the scale of microelectronic engineering continues to shrink, interest has focused on the nature of electron transport through essentially one-dimensional nanometre-scale channels such as quantum wires and carbon nanotubes. Quantum point contacts (QPCs) are structures (generally metallic) in which a 'neck' of atoms just a few atomic diameters wide (that is, comparable to the conduction electrons' Fermi wavelength) bridges two electrical contacts. They can be prepared by contacting a metal surface with a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and by other methods, and typically display a conductance quantized in steps of 2e2/h($\sim$13 k$\Omega$-1), where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. Here we report conductance measurements on metal QPCs prepared with an STM that we can simultaneously image using an ultrahigh-vacuum electron microscope, which allows direct observation of the relation between electron trans- port and structure. We observe strands of gold atoms that are about one nanometre long and one single chain of gold atoms suspended between the electrodes. We can thus verify that the conductance of a single strand of atoms is 2e2/h and that the conductance of a double strand is twice as large, showing that equipartition holds for electron transport in these quantum systems.},

abstract = {Nanotubes and nanowires with both elemental1,2 (carbon or silicon) and multi-element3,5 compositions (such as compound semiconductors or oxides), and exhibiting electronic properties ranging from metallic to semiconducting, are being extensively investigated for use in device structures designed to control electron charge6-8. However, another important degree of freedom - electron spin, the control of which underlies the operation of 'spintronic' devices9 - has been much less explored. This is probably due to the relative paucity of nanometre-scale ferromagnetic building blocks10 (in which electron spins are naturally aligned) from which spin-polarized electrons can be injected. Here we describe nanotubes of vanadium oxide (VOx), formed by controllable self-assembly 11, that are ferromagnetic at room temperature. The as-formed nanotubes are transformed from spin-frustrated semiconductors to ferromagnets by doping with either electrons or holes, potentially offering a route to spin control12 in nanotube-based heterostructures13.},

As prepared nanostructure is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confirming the deposition of Pt nanoclusters on tube surface. The conductance of the individual tube enhances significantly due to Pt deposition at desired locations on the tubes. The value of conductance (in terms of quanta) of the same tube is increased from 3.2 G0 to 11.7 G0 at zero bias after Pt deposition. This enhancement in conductance is explained in terms of change in density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level which results in charge transfer between tubes and nanoclusters. This approach can be used for the applications of tubes in nano-devices which is dependent on the distribution of metal nanostructures, nano gas sensors, and in the interconnections.},

@article{Chu2019,
abstract = {Biochar, a carbon-rich material, has attracted immense attention owing to its applications in soil remediation. However, the mechanisms by which heterogeneous carbon structures of biochars immobilize organic contaminants are not yet fully understood. In this study, the noncondensed aromatic components in biochars were selectively removed through bleaching. Different techniques, such as 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, were applied to characterize the biochar compositions, and thus the role of the different carbon structures in organic contaminant sorption was discussed. The aromatic carbon structures in biochars were gradually developed and evolved from noncondensed to condensed structure with increasing pyrolytic temperatures from 300 to 700 °C. Based on elemental analysis, the carbon removed by bleaching decreased from 43.9% to 5.92% with increasing temperatures. After the surface area normalization of the apparent sorption, bleaching increased the sorption of carbamazepine and bisphenol A on biochars produced at 500 °C, but not for those produced at 300 and 700 °C. Bleaching removed noncondensed aromatics and enriched condensed aromatics, which resulted in increased sorption. However, bleaching also resulted in the blockage of micropores in biochars with abundant condensed aromatics, causing decreased sorption. The apparent sorption was determined by the balancing of these two opposite effects.},

abstract = {In this study, the encapsulation of F(-) in different nanotubes (NTs) has been investigated using electronic structure calculations and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations. The carbon atoms in the single walled carbon nanotube (CNT) are systematically doped with B and N atoms. The effect of the encapsulation of F(-) in the boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) has also been investigated. Electronic structure calculations show that the (7,0) chirality nanotube forms a more stable endohedral complex (with F(-)) than the other nanotubes. Evidence obtained from the band structure of CNT calculations reveals that the band gap of the CNT is marginally affected by the encapsulation. However, the same encapsulation significantly changes the band gap of the BNNT. The density of states (DOS) derived from the calculations shows significant changes near the Fermi level. The snapshots obtained from the CPMD simulation highlight the fluctuation of the anion inside the tube and there is more fluctuation in BNNT than in CNT.},

It was found that the number of possible cluster isomers N quickly grows with a number of atoms n; however, it is significantly lower than the number of possible nonisomorphic graph structures, which can be drawn for the given n. At the DFT potential energy surface, we found only 543 local minima corresponding to the isomers of Mg2-Mg13. The number of isomers obtained in the DFT optimizations grows with n approximately as n4, whereas the N values extrapolated to the infinite generation process grow as n8. The cluster geometries obtained from the global DFT optimization were then used to adjust two empirical potentials of Gupta type (GP) and modified Sutton-Chen type (SCG3) describing the interactions between the magnesium atoms. Using these potentials, the extensive sets of structures Mg2-Mg55 (up to 30,000 clusters for each n) were optimized to obtain the dependence of the cluster isomer count on n in the continuous range of n = 2-30 and for selected n up to n = 55. It was found that the SCG3 potential, which is closer to the DFT results, gives a number of possible isomers growing as approximately n8.9, whereas GP potential results in the n4.3 dependence.},

abstract = {As the new era of the Internet of Things(IoT) is driving the evolution of conventional Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks into the Internet of Vehicles(IoV), vehicles are equipped with different kinds of sensor and become a sensing node themselves in IoV. Consequently, complexity of the automotive electronic system inside the vehicles are daily increasing. To guarantee the safe operation of vehicles, it is of great significance to acquire vehicle data in real-time to realize the on-line diagnosis, cyber-security attacking detection and et al. In this paper, we propose to realize a STM32-based data acquisition system(DAS), where the vehicle data transferred on CAN networks are acquired through the OBD2(On-Broad Diagnosis) interface. And then, the acquired vehicle data are parsed and analyzed preliminarily according to the OBD2 protocol, and then shown on a LED displayer. Through the implementation of a prototype system, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design of DAS is verified.},

abstract = {One option for extending the performance of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices based on silicon technology is to use semiconducting carbon nanotubes as the gates. Qiu et al. fabricated top-gated carbon nanotube field-effect transistors with a gate length of 5 nm. Thin graphene contacts helped maintain electrostatic control. A scaling trend study revealed that, compared with silicon CMOS devices, the nanotube-based devices operated much faster and at much lower supply voltage, and they approached the limit of one electron per switching operation.

abstract = {Metallic nanorods exhibit fascinating optical properties due to surface plasmons - collective oscillation of the electron cloud within a particle. They exhibit two principle absorption bands that correspond to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) along the longitudinal and transverse directions of the nanorod. Most importantly, the longitudinal band can be tuned with the aspect ratio of the rod, making it a spectrally tuneable optical material, which can be applied to a variety of devices from bioimaging to high-density optical storage. Here, spectral encoding for high-density optical storage applications is demonstrated on two sizes of gold nanorods (aspect ratios of three and five) doped in a silica sol-gel matrix by femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation. It is widely known that high-power pulsed laser irradiation causes metal nanorods to undergo shape transformations via the process of melting or fragmentation. The process is enhanced if the laser wavelength is tuned at the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance peak of the nanorods, which results in a significant reduction or shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak. As such a shape change occurs only on the subpopulation of rods that have a longitudinal plasmon band matching the laser wavelength, a size- or spectrum-selective shape transition is possible in a rod mixture with varying aspect ratios. The current spectral encoding technology can be incorporated into existing optical disc technology, such as three-dimensional bit-by-bit and holographic, and can increase the capacity limit by utilizing the spectral domain. {\textcopyright} 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract = {We have developed the first computer program for determining the coordinates of heterojunctions between two arbitrary carbon nanotubes. This software implements the topological algebra based on the concept of strip, a continuous subset of carbon rings containing all the topological defects (nonhexagonal carbon rings). The user easily generates any heterojunction by merely introducing the indices (i,j) and length of the two nanotubes to be connected. The resulting structure is immediately visualized and can be exported in the protein-data-bank (PDB) format. Two classes of heterojunctions are distinguished depending on whether a cone between the connected nanotubes is required. This method is applicable to all kinds of two nanotube heterojunctions, including Dunlap's knees and others related. In addition, this program also generates single- and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (SWNT and MWNT). This application has been implemented as a Java applet, and it is freely available at the following web address: http://www.ugr.es/local/gmdm/java/contub/contub.html},

Many characteristics of both o-MWCNTs and its coating were examined in detail such as chemical structure, crystal phase, anticorrosion, morphology, mechanical property. The presence of o-MWCNTs helps to improve anti-corrosion for epoxy coating in comparison with pure epoxy coating and epoxy coating embedded with pristine MWCNTs. The result of mechanical testing indicated that the o-MWCNTs induced the higher hardness and lower modulus when compared with pure epoxy coating and epoxy/MWCNTs coating.},

Our results predict that lithium can be adsorbed on zig-zag nanotubes with a charge transfer, an adsorption energy, and a vibration frequency which depend on the tube radius and whether the adatom approaches the surface from outside (exo-way) or inside (endo-way). Adsorbed lithium allows the anchoring of molecular hydrogen on the carbon nanotube with a binding energy in a chemisorption regime compared to previous experimental and theoretical works which show that H2 is physisorbed. We also predict that a shift of the hydrogen stretching mode upon adsorption should be observable experimentally by vibrational spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Despite the great progress in medical sciences, cancer is still a major health problem. Since the majority of cancer treatment protocols include first-generation chemotherapeutic agents, side effects and drug resistance are still a concerning issue. Therefore, targeted and selective solution for standard chemotherapeutics is needed more than ever. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have remarkable size and surface properties that make them the ideal vehicle for targeted and selective drug delivery. Different in vitro and in vivo experiments proved that these particles can be easily engineered in such a way that the chemical drug can be delivered directly to the tumor site. Moreover, different types of ligands can be loaded on the surface of GNPs to enhance selectivity or modulate drug release. Furthermore, the anti-angiogenic and photothermal properties of these particles can be used to potentialize the drug action. However, more studies must be conducted to elucidate all the toxicity issues and to acquire additional knowledge on the long-term health effects and interaction with all the human body's physiological mechanisms.},

However, there is still a demand for effective storage devices to conserve electrical energy which addresses the wide range of large stationary applications from electric vehicles to small portable devices. Among the large variety of energy-storage systems avail-able today, electrochemical energy sources and, in particular, supercapacitors (SC), are rather prom-ising in terms of cost, scaling, power management, life cycle and safety. Therefore, this review sur-veys recent achievements in the development of SC based on composites of such carbon-derived materials as graphene (G) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with carbon nanotubes (CNT). Vari-ous factors influencing the specific capacitance are discussed, while specific energy and power as well as cycling stability of SC with G/rGO-CNT composite electrode materials are overviewed.},

@article{Adohi2010,
abstract = {Multiple-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)-and carbon black (CB)-polymer composites have been fabricated by mechanical mixing with different loadings, the polymeric matrix being identical between the two series of samples. The main focus of this work is to report measurements of physical properties of these mixtures in ambient conditions and to discuss the origin of similarities and differences among them according the kind of carbonaceous filler. The uniform dispersion of the carbonaceous phase in the dielectric matrix was probed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good dispersibility of the filler particle is also reflected in the much lower conduction threshold observed for CNT-containing samples than in the CB composites. This is likely due to the high aspect ratio of the CNTs.Mechanical properties show that the storage modulus of the two kinds of samples is close to the modulus value of the neat styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), independent of filler content over a wide range of compositions ( ϕ < 0.1 ) encompassing the percolation threshold. Microwave measurements show that the real part of the effective permittivity exhibits a flat frequency response, with the exception of the sample containing 30 vol % CB for which an inverse-power law is observed revealing a behavior that has been seen for many random heterogeneous soft materials. No resonant dielectric absorption is evidenced within the frequency range explored and for the filler concentrations investigated. The results were also compared with analytical effective (mean-field) models. The symmetric Bruggeman model is in very good agreement with the microwave effective permittivity once account is taken of the depolarization factor which is close to the value found for a three-dimensional (3D) random dispersion of monodisperse spherical conductive inclusions within a dielectric matrix. By combining microwave frequency-domain spectroscopy with uniaxial tension, we obtain the effective permittivity as a function of the elongation ratio. Our results indicate that the effective permittivity spectrum of the CNT-polymer samples and their CB-based counterparts is not very sensitive to the applied stress in the range of elongation ratios explored. For the sample containing 30 vol % CB, the relative variation in the effective permittivity as a function of the elongation ratio is well described by the Gaussian molecular network model. The experimentally determined mechanical and microwaveproperties of these nanocomposites is related to the change in the mesostructure, formed by the heterogeneous 3D interconnected network of polymer and of aggregates (or agglomerates) of filler particles, as the composite is stretched. The results of this study provide another insight and opportunities to the comprehension of multifunctional materials, including novel nanoelectronic components, and carbon-based systems.},

@article{Wang2017,
abstract = {The sorption behavior of bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) on graphene was investigated and compared with that on activated carbon. The kinetic studies showed that BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon reached equilibrium within 240 min, whereas TCS sorption on these two materials achieved equilibrium in 60 and 120 min. The maximum sorption capacity (qm) of BPA on graphene or activated carbon reached approximately 2.0 × 103 $\mu$g/g, which indicated that graphene was not superior to traditional activated carbon for BPA removal. By contrast, the strong partitioning ability of TCS on graphene suggested the potential use of graphene materials to remove TCS from wastewater. Although the pH change from 4.0 to 7.0 did not greatly affect BPA or TCS sorption, the sorption decreased dramatically when the pH was increased from 7.0 to 9.0. This phenomenon should be attributed to the establishment of electrostatic repulsion between anionic BPA (or TCS) molecules and the graphene (or activated carbon) surface under higher pH conditions. The increase of ion (NaCl and CaCl2) concentrations may lead to substantial increase of BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon due to the salting-out effect. By contrast, ion concentrations had no significant effect on TCS sorption because of the dominant hydrophobic interaction.},

abstract = {We model and simulate gas flow through nanopores using a single-walled carbon nanotube model. Efficient protocols for the simulation of methane molecules in nanotubes are developed and validated for both the self-diffusivity, following a pulse perturbation, and for the transport diffusivity in an imposed concentration gradient. The former is found to be at least an order of magnitude lower than the latter, and to decline with increasing initial pressure, while the latter increases as the pressure gradient increases until it reaches an asymptotic value. Our previous analytic model, developed for single-file diffusion in narrow pores, is extended to wider pores for the case of single species transport. The model, which predicts the observed numerical results invokes four regimes of transport. The dominant transport is by ballistic motion near the wall in not too wide nanotubes when a pressure gradient or concentration is imposed; this mode is absent in the case of self-diffusion due to periodic boundary conditions. We also present results from systematic comparisons of flexible versus rigid tubes and explicit atom versus effective atomic potentials.},

abstract = {Biomolecules-carbon nanotube (CNT) interactions are of great importance in CNT-based drug delivery systems and biomedical devices. In this study, a spontaneous encapsulation of a globular protein into the CNT was observed through molecular dynamics simulation. The free energy of the system was found to be decreased after the encapsulation, which is the most fundamental reason for this spontaneous process. The system enthalpy decrease was found to make a dominant contribution to the free-energy change, and the system entropy increase also contributes to the spontaneous process. During the insertion, the protein makes a stepwise conformational change to maximize its affinity to the CNT walls as well as the protein-CNT interactions, mainly resulting in the deformation of the beta-sheets in the protein. As a whole, the CNT was considered to attract protein molecules nonspecifically although the groups with high hydrophobicity and/or aromatic rings show great affinity.},

The unique physicochemical properties of CNTs make them among prime candidates for numerous applications in biomedical fields including drug delivery, gene therapy, biosensors, and tissue engineering applications. However, toxicity of CNTs has been a major concern for their use in biomedical applications. In this review, we present an overview of carbon nanotubes in biomedical applications; we particularly focus on various factors and mechanisms affecting their toxicity. We have discussed various parameters including the size, length, agglomeration, and impurities of CNTs that may cause oxidative stress, which is often the main mechanism of CNTs' toxicity. Other toxic pathways are also examined, and possible ways to overcome these challenges have been discussed.},

We develop an approach to detect noncovalent interactions in real space, based on the electron density and its derivatives. Our approach reveals the underlying chemistry that compliments the covalent structure. It provides a rich representation of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and steric repulsion in small molecules, molecular complexes, and solids. Most importantly, the method, requiring only knowledge of the atomic coordinates, is efficient and applicable to large systems, such as proteins or DNA. Across these applications, a view of nonbonded interactions emerges as continuous surfaces rather than close contacts between atom pairs, offering rich insight into the design of new and improved ligands. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We present wannier90, a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWF) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWF in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWF for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system. Wannier functions and interpolated band structure output in a variety of file formats for visualisation. Running time: Test cases take 1 minute. References: [1] N. Marzari, D.

abstract = {In this review, we provide a consistent description of noncovalent interactions, covering most groups of the Periodic Table. Different types of bonds are discussed using their trivial names. Moreover, the new name "Spodium bonds" is proposed for group 12 since noncovalent interactions involving this group of elements as electron acceptors have not yet been named. Excluding hydrogen bonds, the following noncovalent interactions will be discussed: alkali, alkaline earth, regium, spodium, triel, tetrel, pnictogen, chalcogen, halogen, and aerogen, which almost covers the Periodic Table entirely. Other interactions, such as orthogonal interactions and $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking, will also be considered. Research and applications of $\sigma$-hole and $\pi$-hole interactions involving the p-block element is growing exponentially. The important applications include supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering, catalysis, enzymatic chemistry molecular machines, membrane ion transport, etc. Despite the fact that this review is not intended to be comprehensive, a number of representative works for each type of interaction is provided. The possibility of modeling the dissociation energies of the complexes using different models (HSAB, ECW, Alkorta-Legon) was analyzed. Finally, the extension of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to noncovalent is proposed.},

abstract = {Pharmacotherapy and imaging are two critical facets of cancer therapy. Carbon nanotubes and their modified species such as magnetic or gold nanoparticle conjugated ones they have been introduced as good candidates for both purposes. Gold nanoparticles enhance effects of X-rays during radiotherapy. Nanomaterial-mediated radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia refers to using RF to heat tumors treated with nanomaterials for cancer therapy. The combination of hyperthermia and radiotherapy, synergistically, causes a significant reduction in X-ray doses. The present study was conducted to investigate the ability and efficiency of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with magnetic Fe3O4 and gold nanoparticles (mf-MWCNT/AuNPs) for imaging and cancer therapy. The mf-MWCNT/AuNPs were utilized for imaging approaches such as ultrasounds, CT scan, and MRI. They were also examined in thermotherapy and radiotherapy. The MCF-7 cell line was used as an in vitro model to study thermotherapy and radiotherapy. The mf-MWCNT/AuNPs are beneficial as a contrast agent in imaging by ultrasounds, CT scan, and MRI. They are also radio waves and X-rays absorbent and enhance the efficiency of thermotherapy and radiotherapy in the elimination of cancer cells. The valuable properties of mf-MWCNT/AuNPs in radio- and thermotherapies and imaging strategies make them a good candidate as a multimodal tool in cancer therapy.

abstract = {Galvanic replacement reaction between silver nanowires and an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 has been successfully monitored in real time by using in situ transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) in combination with a flow cell reactor. The in situ observations clearly show the morphological evolution of the solid silver nanowires to hollow gold nanotubes in the course of the reaction. Careful analysis of the images reveals that the galvanic replacement reaction on the silver nanowires involves multiple steps: (i) local initiation of pitting process; (ii) anisotropic etching of the silver nanowires and uniform deposition of the resulting gold atoms on the surfaces of the nanowires; and (iii) reconstruction of the nanotube walls via an Ostwald ripening process.

Different approaches to background subtraction, choice of line profile, and calculation of full width at half-maximum are discussed both in the context of previous literature and the contemporary understanding of carbon nanotube photophysics. The fitting is improved by the inclusion of exciton–phonon sidebands, and new techniques to improve the individualization of overlapped nanotube spectra by exploiting correlations between the first- and second-order optical transitions and the exciton–phonon sidebands are presented. Consideration of metallic nanotubes allows an analysis of the metallic/semiconducting content, and a process of constraining the fit of highly congested spectra of carbon nanotube solid films according to the spectral weights of each (n, m) species in solution is also presented, allowing for more reliable resolution of overlapping peaks into single (n, m) species con...},

abstract = {In Part I the theoretical and experimental conditions which must be satisfied in order to determine lattice constants with a precision of a few parts per hundred thousand are discussed with particular application to the symmetrical focusing type of camera. Cohen's method of calculation of lattice constants for the elimination of ``drift'' and experimental errors is applied. Methods are developed for the evaluation of standard errors and fiduciary limits of results from a single film and from a set of films. The usefulness of x‐ray targets made of alloys rather than pure elements for the purpose of securing a larger number and better distribution of lines is indicated. The influence of the number and Miller indices of diffraction lines on the values of lattice constants in noncubic systems is shown. The importance of the methods of sample preparation for precision work is emphasized. In Part II, precision measurements on Al, Ni, Ag, Au, Si, Fe, Mo, W, Mg, Zn, Cd, Sb, Bi and Sn are reported for materials of a high degree of purity. The fiduciary limits of these lattice constants vary between 2 and 7 parts per hundred thousand and are so chosen that the probability of the correct value lying between the stated limits is 19 out of 20.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND To evaluate treatment by thalidomide and identify predictive factors of survival, event free survival and response among patients with advanced multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide as single agent therapy. PATIENTS AND TREATMENT Patients with advanced multiple myeloma (n=83) were treated with an oral dose of thalidomide (median 400 mg/day). At start of treatment, all patients had active disease and 58 (69%) had received at least one autologous transplantation. RESULTS With a median follow-up of 338 days (range, 247-629 days), 52 patients are alive, whereas 31 died between 8 and 150 days after the first administration of thalidomide. The response to thalidomide was considered as major in 11 patients (13%), partial in 29 patients (35%) and minor in 15 patients (18%), giving a total response rate of 66% (54 out of 83 patients). Thirteen patients had stable disease and 15 patients progressed. In multivariable analysis, age greater than 60 years, short interval between diagnosis and onset of thalidomide, requirement for red blood cell transfusion, IgA isotype, platelets' count <80 x 10(9)/l and serum albumin level <30 g/l at the start of thalidomide were associated with poor outcome. These three last factors produced a simplified prognostic model for patients with advanced myeloma and treated with thalidomide. Thus, among the 38 patients without any of these unfavorable risk features, one-year overall survival and event free survival were 87% and 78%. By contrast, the 43 patients with at least one unfavorable feature had one-year overall survival and event free survival of 40% and 32%, respectively (Log-Rank, P=0.0002 for both). Patients who received > or =34.4 g of thalidomide in the first 90 days of treatment had a better outcome than those who received <34.4 g. However, the mean received daily dose of thalidomide in the first 90 days has not been found to influence survival, event free survival or response. Short-term side effects of thalidomide were generally moderate. CONCLUSION Thalidomide is an effective treatment for patients with advanced myeloma, in particular, who have no poor-risk features. The poor results achieved by the other patients emphasize the need for prospective protocols using thalidomide in combination, especially with dexamethasone. In addition, further studies are needed to determine the optimal thalidomide dose and duration.},

abstract = {Current methods for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) lead to heterogeneous samples containing mixtures of metallic and semiconducting species with a variety of lengths and defects. Optical detection at the single nanotube level should thus offer the possibility to examine these heterogeneities provided that both SWNT species are equally well detected. Here, we used photothermal heterodyne detection to record absorption images and spectra of individual SWNTs. Because this photothermal method relies only on light absorption, it readily detects metallic nanotubes as well as the emissive semiconducting species. The first and second optical transitions in individual semiconducting nanotubes have been probed. Comparison between the emission and absorption spectra of the lowest-lying optical transition reveal mainly small Stokes shifts. Side bands in the near-infrared absorption spectra are observed and assigned to exciton-phonon bound states. No such sidebands are detected around the lowest transition of metallic nanotubes.},

abstract = {Rayleigh scattering spectra and Raman spectra from single bundles of aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been obtained with dark field optical microscopy and Raman microscopy. Rayleigh scattering spectrum reveals resonance peaks due to the optically allowed interband transitions in SWNTs. The intensity of the resonance peaks was found to depend strongly on the incident light polarization. These resonance peaks are completely suppressed when the incident light polarization is perpendicular to the nanotube axis, suggesting that the interband transition dipole in SWNTs is orientated parallel to the tube axis. Polarized Raman measurements on aligned nanotubes in a single bundle show that the Raman scattering is polarized along the nanotube axis direction, and Raman scattering signal is strongest when the incident laser is polarized parallel to the tube axis. All strong Raman active modes behave as A1g. Tangential carbon stretching mode Raman scattering from semiconducting tubes shows very little change from bundle to bundle, while that from metallic SWNTs exhibits large variations. The broadened metallic Raman scattering at 1550 cm-1 can be well fitted by a Fano line shape function. This broadened Raman scattering depends sensitively on sample processing conditions. Charge transfer due to chemical doping is proposed to explain the change in Raman scattering from oxidized metallic tubes. Introduction},

All three metal species form Schottky barriers when contacting small diameter nanotubes. Two most important atomic geometrical factors influencing the Schottky barrier height are identified as the metal species and its surface orientation. Pd is found to have the lowest Schottky barrier.

abstract = {With the ever-increasing demands of electrochemical energy storage, lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have drawn more attention because of their superior theoretical energy density and high specific capacity. However, practical applications of Li–S batteries suffer from problems such as low conductivity of sulfur and discharged products, severe polysulfide shuttling effect, and large volume change of sulfur during cycling, resulting in sluggish rate performance, and unsatisfactory cycle life. Various nanostructured carbon materials have been served as barrier layers to overcome these problems. In particular, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with unique 1D nanostructure, have been introduced to Li–S batteries as the intermediate layers because of its superior flexibility, excellent electrical conductivity, and good chemical stability. Moreover, CNTs and CNTs-based barrier layers could also curb lithium polysulfides shuttling. In the minireview, we summarize recent works of CNTs-based materials as modifying interlayers for Li–S batteries. In addition, the strategies to enhance electrochemical performances of the batteries are summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects for future research of CNTs-based materials as interlayer are proposed. We hope this review will be useful for designing and fabricating high-performance Li–S batteries and boost their practical applications.},
